## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Label-matcher regex flags escaped the anchors.** `AnchorLabelMatcherRegex`
  hoisted leading inline flags in front of `^…$`, so `(?m)foo` became
  `(?m)^(?:foo)$` — and under `(?m)` the anchors match at LINE boundaries, which
  let the value `"foo\nbar"` satisfy a matcher for `foo`. Flags are now scoped
  to the body (`^(?:(?m:foo))$`), nesting successive groups in order. An empty
  pattern is anchored too (`=~""` matches only the empty value, where before it
  returned unanchored and matched anything).
- **A line filter containing the text `| stats ` looked like a second stats
  stage.** The multi-stage detector scanned raw text, so `{...} |= "| stats "`
  routed a one-stage query away from the stats-compat layer. It now scans with
  quoted spans blanked (`stripQuotedSpans`), so only real pipe stages count.
- **Two-stage aggregations with `range > step` are rejected instead of answered
  wrongly.** VictoriaLogs buckets `stats_query_range` by `step` (tumbling) while
  a LogQL range aggregation is a sliding `range` window; they agree only while
  `range <= step`. `query_range` outside that now returns 400 naming the
  mismatch and the two workarounds. Instant queries and single-stage sliding
  queries are unaffected. See `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

- **An outer aggregation over a range grouping dropped one of the two clauses.**
  `sum by (app) (quantile_over_time(...) by (namespace))` carries an inner range
  grouping AND an outer grouping; a single LogsQL stats stage holds only one, so
  the outer `sum by (app)` was discarded and the query returned per-namespace
  quantiles with no sum applied — a plausible-looking wrong number, not an
  error. The inner grouping now keeps the first stage and the outer aggregation
  gets its own (`| stats by (app) sum(__lvp_inner)`). The same defect was in the
  generic unwrap path (`max_over_time`, `avg_over_time`, `stdvar_over_time`),
  not only in `quantile_over_time`.
- **The stats-compat layer served the INNER result for two-stage aggregations.**
  It models one fold and read its grouping from the FIRST stats stage, so
  `sum by (container) (max_over_time(...) by (namespace))` came back as
  `{container="<namespace value>"}` holding the per-namespace max — the outer
  sum never ran, and the label was the inner one renamed. `sum(... by (ns))` was
  already wrong this way before the change above. Genuine two-stage
  aggregations now fall through to VictoriaLogs, which executes both stages
  correctly; `| math` rate pipelines keep their existing manual handling.
- **`count_values()` stays rejected with 400 — it is not a LogQL operator.** An
  earlier revision of this branch implemented it as a post-aggregation; real
  Loki 3.7.1 answers `parse error at line 1, col 1: syntax error: unexpected
  IDENTIFIER` for `count_values("app", count_over_time({app="x"}[5m]))`, so
  serving it made the proxy return data for a query the reference implementation
  rejects. The e2e error-parity suite classes that as a SILENT FAIL, and it is
  the worse compatibility bug. The 400 message now names the LogQL spelling that
  does work: `sum by (<field>) (count_over_time(...))`.

- **`=~` / `!~` label matchers reached VictoriaLogs UNANCHORED.** Loki anchors a
  label-matcher regexp to the whole label value, so `{namespace=~"nch"}` matches
  only the exact value `nch`. VL's `field:~"re"` is a substring match, so the
  pattern was passed through verbatim and every `=~` matcher silently widened:
  `{namespace=~"nch"}` matched `anch` and `nch-b`, and `{namespace=~"ppx"}`
  matched `appx`. A widened matcher inflates counts instead of erroring, so
  nothing surfaced it. Label matchers are now emitted as `^(?:<re>)$` in both
  stream selectors and `| label =~ …` pipeline filters, including over
  `-field-mapping` fallback chains and the synthetic `service_name` expansion.
  The non-capturing group is required: `^a|b$` parses as `(^a)|(b$)` and would
  match any value containing `a` or ending in `b`. Leading inline flags are
  hoisted (`(?i)prod` → `(?i)^(?:prod)$`). **Line filters (`|~`, `!~` on the log
  line) stay unanchored** — those are substring regexps in Loki too. No flag:
  this is Loki compatibility, not an option.
- **Instant `rate(...)` emitted an empty `level=""` label.** Grouping by the
  derived level makes VL return a `level` column for every series, empty where
  the field is absent. Loki emits no label at all in that case; the empty one
  reached Grafana as a real series dimension. Empty-valued `level` /
  `detected_level` are now dropped from metric responses.

- **Instant `quantile_over_time(...) by (labels)` ignored its grouping.**
  `quantile_over_time` is intercepted by its own two-argument translator before
  the generic metric-function loop, and that interceptor never parsed the
  trailing `by (...)` / `by ()` modifier. Grouping then fell through to the
  parser-pipeline default `by (_stream, _msg)`, so
  `quantile_over_time(0.95, {ns=~"app.+"} | json | unwrap Duration [10m]) by (namespace)`
  returned one series per POD on the instant path and one series per LOG LINE on
  the range path instead of one per namespace. Without a parser pipeline the
  clause was dropped entirely, collapsing every namespace into one series. The
  clause is now honoured exactly as it already was for the single-argument
  siblings (`max_over_time`, `avg_over_time`, …). Verified against VictoriaLogs
  v1.52.0.
- **`sum by (detected_level)` returned both `detected_level` and `level`.** On
  the manual (parser-stage) metric path, by-fields that only exist after a
  parser stage were injected under their VL name after the VL→Loki rename had
  already run, re-adding the pre-rename label. The response carried one grouping
  dimension more than Loki returns, which renames every Grafana series.

- **Derived-level queries returned HTTP 400 from VictoriaLogs.** Two generated
  constructs are not valid LogsQL: there is no `coalesce` PIPE (`unexpected pipe
  "coalesce"`), and `replace`/`replace_regexp` take the field LAST
  (`| replace_regexp ("<re>", "<repl>") at <field>`), not first — the
  three-argument form fails with `missing ')' after 'replace_regexp("level", …'`.
  Both parse cleanly in this repo's own LogsQL parser, so unit tests passed while
  every `{…, level="error"}` and `sum by (level)` query failed against a real
  backend. `PipeReplace` / `PipeReplaceRegexp` now emit the accepted syntax, and
  level materialisation is built from a `| format if (<field>:*) "<<field>>" as
  level` chain applied lowest-priority-first. Verified against VictoriaLogs
  v1.52.0.
- **Level materialisation now fires only on queries that GROUP by level**
  (`by (level)` / `without (detected_level)`), not on any query mentioning the
  word. A matcher is already served by the filter pipes, so the unpack + format +
  replace chain was pure cost on plain log queries.

### Added

- **`-field-mapping` fallback chains.** A `loki_label` may map to an ordered
  `vl_fields` list instead of a single `vl_field`. Positive matchers become a
  LogsQL disjunction, negative matchers a conjunction of negations, label values
  the union over the chain, and the value in results the first non-empty field.
  Reproduces an ingest-time coalesce (`app` = pod label `app`, else
  `app.kubernetes.io/name`) at query time.
- **`-computed-labels`.** Synthesises a Loki label by joining others, e.g.
  `job = "<namespace>/<app>"`. `=`/`!=` split on the separator; `=~` returns 400
  with a message naming the joined labels to match instead.
- **`-derived-level-fields` / `-derived-level-group-by`.** Serves
  `level`/`detected_level` from the message body over the configured raw level
  fields, normalising `information` → `info`, `warning` → `warn`,
  `err`/`fatal`/`critical` → `error`, with a `debug`/`warn`/`error` substring
  fallback. Opt-in group-by materialises `level` server-side.
- **`-line-field=_msg`.** Returns the original message as the Loki log line
  instead of the whole VL record re-encoded as JSON, falling back to the JSON
  form for records VL ingested without a `_msg` field.

### Fixed

- **`/loki/api/v1/label/<name>/values` was empty for field-mapped labels.**
  `stream_field_values` only knows VL's stream index, so a mapped label backed by
  a plain column answered 200 with an empty list — indistinguishable from "no
  values". The lookup now retries that candidate through `field_values`.
- **Mapped and computed labels are exposed as stream labels** in query results
  (previously structured metadata only), so `sum by (app)` and `| label_format`
  can see them, and mapped VL fields are added to the declared label surface so
  `/loki/api/v1/labels` lists them.
- **`| regexp` / `| pattern` capture groups never became labels.** Fields named by
  a query-time parser cannot be found in the log body, so the response classifier
  filed them as structured metadata; they are now classified as parsed fields and
  merged into the stream label set, which restores `sum by (<name>)`,
  `unwrap <name>` and `| label_format` on them.

### Security

- **Closed the last two code-scanning findings.**
  - **CodeQL `go/clear-text-logging`** (`internal/proxy/query_translation.go`): the
    request log no longer emits `auth.principal` at all. The Basic-Auth username
    (and anything derived from it) is credential material and is now kept out of
    the log entirely, in every code path; only the auth *mechanism* (`auth.source`,
    a constant) is recorded. Identity for audit is carried by the trusted-proxy
    `enduser.*` fields.
  - **Semgrep `httpsconnection-detected`** (`scripts/check-vl-ast-coverage.py`):
    replaced `http.client.HTTPSConnection` with `urllib.request` using the default
    verified TLS context and a fixed, non-user-controlled URL. The companion
    `dynamic-urllib-use-detected` rule (a false positive for this constant URL) is
    added to the Semgrep `--exclude-rule` allowlist in `security-heavy.yaml`.
- **Fixed the `Security Heavy / fuzz` job.** `go test -fuzz=FuzzExtractLogPatterns`
  refused to run because the unanchored pattern also matched the newer
  `FuzzExtractLogPatternsFromWindowEntries` target (`-fuzz` must match exactly one).
  All `-fuzz` patterns are now anchored (`^...$`), and the previously-uncovered
  window-entries target is now fuzzed too.

### Changed

- **Maintenance sweep to current versions.** Go modules (`go get -u ./...` +
  `go mod tidy`): klauspost/compress 1.19.0 → 1.20.0, golang.org/x/sync 0.22.0
  → 0.23.0, golang.org/x/sys 0.45.0 → 0.48.0. No major-version jumps, no
  replace directives; `bench/` is stdlib-only and produced no diff.
- **Runtime base image `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot` →
  `static-debian13:nonroot`.** `distroless/static:nonroot` resolves to the same
  digest as debian13, which is upstream's current line (debian12 is the trailing
  one), and the debian13 index also ships riscv64. The binary is
  `CGO_ENABLED=0` static, so nothing in the image links against the distro.
  Builder stays `golang:1.27.1-alpine3.24`: alpine3.24 is the newest alpine
  variant for any golang 1.27.x tag.
- **CI pins to latest**: `docker/setup-buildx-action` v4.2.0 → v4.3.0,
  govulncheck v1.1.4 → v1.8.0, golangci-lint v2.11.4 → v2.13.2, and in the
  tag-pinned ECR workflow `actions/checkout` v4 → v7 and `actions/cache` v5 →
  v6. Every other `uses:` was already at its latest release.
- **Dependabot covers `bench/`** (a second go module, previously unwatched) and
  groups docker updates so the Dockerfile's two base images arrive in one PR.
  Dependabot alerts and security updates — disabled by default on a fork, so
  the inherited config was producing nothing — are now enabled on the repo.

## [1.63.0] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Dockerfile builder image tag corrected to `golang:1.26.5-alpine3.24`.** The
  Go 1.26.5 bump referenced `golang:1.26.5-alpine3.22`, which does not exist on
  Docker Hub (Alpine moved to 3.23/3.24 for the 1.26.5 line), breaking the
  `docker` build and all e2e jobs on `main`. Verified the image builds.

### Security

- **Go toolchain bumped to 1.26.5** across the Dockerfile builder image, `go.mod`
  (`bench/go.mod`), and every CI `setup-go` pin, to pick up the patched standard
  library for **CVE-2026-42505** (crypto/tls Encrypted Client Hello information
  disclosure) and **CVE-2026-39822** (`os.Root` symlink-following directory
  traversal). Rebuilding the `loki-vl-proxy` and `healthcheck` binaries against the
  fixed stdlib clears both findings from the Trivy filesystem scan that was failing
  the Security workflow on `main`. No behavioral change.
- **Website (docs) npm dependencies patched — 9 Dependabot alerts cleared.**
  Added `overrides` in `website/package.json` to force safe versions of the
  vulnerable transitive packages: `js-yaml` (→4.3.0), `ws` (→8.21.x),
  `shell-quote` (→1.10.0), `brace-expansion` (→1.1.16), `webpack-dev-server`
  (→5.2.6), `http-proxy-middleware` (→2.0.10), `joi` (→17.13.4), `body-parser`
  (→1.20.6), and `@babel/core` (→7.29.7). Because gray-matter pins js-yaml v3's
  removed `safeLoad`, `website/docusaurus.config.ts` now supplies a js-yaml v4
  `load` engine via `markdown.parseFrontMatter`. `npm audit` reports **0
  vulnerabilities** (including newer transitive advisories in dompurify,
  fast-uri and svgo, cleared via lockfile patch bumps); the site build and
  typecheck pass. Docs-site only — no proxy runtime change.
- **Basic-Auth principal is now fingerprinted in the request log.** The
  `auth.principal` field in the structured request log carried the Basic-Auth
  username verbatim — credential material read from the `Authorization` header
  (flagged by CodeQL `go/clear-text-logging` in
  `internal/proxy/query_translation.go`). It is now routed through the same
  `redactQuery` fingerprint (`sha256:<8hex> len=<n>`) used for raw queries, and
  is emitted verbatim only under `-debug-log-raw-queries=true`. The Basic-Auth
  password was never logged. Trusted-proxy `enduser.*` audit fields are
  unchanged.
- **All GitHub Actions are now pinned to commit SHAs** (with a `# vN` comment so
  Dependabot keeps them current), clearing 143 Semgrep
  `github-actions-mutable-action-tag` code-scanning findings across 18 workflows.
- **Dependabot `cooldown` (7 days) added** to every update ecosystem
  (github-actions, gomod, docker), so fresh releases bake before a PR is opened —
  clears the `dependabot-missing-cooldown` findings.
- **`scripts/check-vl-ast-coverage.py`**: moved the `nosemgrep` suppression onto
  the `HTTPSConnection` match line (Semgrep only honors it on the match line or
  the line directly above), clearing the `httpsconnection-detected` finding. The
  connection is to a fixed, trusted host with default TLS verification.

## [1.62.0] - 2026-06-11

### Breaking Changes

- **Helm: enabling the ServiceMonitor now requires an explicit metrics-scrape scope.**
  With `serviceMonitor.enabled=true` and `networkPolicy.enabled=true`, the chart used to
  render a NetworkPolicy that opened the `/metrics` port to **all** sources (zero-config
  allow-all). It now **fails `helm template`/`helm upgrade`** unless one of
  `networkPolicy.monitoringNamespace`, `networkPolicy.monitoringFrom`, or the new
  `networkPolicy.monitoringAllowAll=true` is set. Affected: chart users with the
  ServiceMonitor and NetworkPolicy both enabled and no scrape scope configured — their
  next `helm upgrade` will error until they pick one. To restore the previous
  open-to-all behavior, set `networkPolicy.monitoringAllowAll=true`; to scope it
  (recommended), set `networkPolicy.monitoringNamespace` (a namespace name) or
  `networkPolicy.monitoringFrom` (an explicit `NetworkPolicyPeer` list).

### Security

- **Backend error bodies are now redacted on every remaining client-visible error path.**
  1.58.1 routed the main handlers through `redactBackendError`, but several deeper paths
  still returned raw VictoriaLogs `4xx`/`5xx` bodies — derived-volume hits, the
  `stats_query_range`/`/hits` fast paths, the metric-range and query-translation backends,
  and the detected-fields/label backends — and a VL parse/error message can echo the
  translated LogsQL query (stream selectors, filter values). All of these now go through
  `redactedBackendErrorMessage`/`redactedBackendStatusError`, which extract VL's message
  and strip query-like content. The redactor also now masks single-quoted and
  backtick-quoted literals (≥12 chars), not just double-quoted, so quoted values in VL
  errors can no longer leak. No-op under `-debug-log-raw-queries=true`.

### Fixed

- **Grafana Explore/dashboard metric ranges at 24h+ are no longer blanked by Drilldown
  residual suppression.** The querySplitting residual-chunk suppression (empty matrix for
  a sub-step trailing chunk) is now scoped to Drilldown-tagged traffic
  (`isGrafanaDrilldownRequest`) instead of all Grafana-sourced requests
  (`isGrafanaSourcedRequest`). Explore and dashboard panels rely on per-chunk axis
  trimming alone, which keeps them spike-free without ever returning an empty chunk —
  verified across all source tags in `TestLock_GrafanaMergedFrames_NoRightEdgeSpike`.
- **Direct, non-Grafana high-cardinality `count() by(field)` queries now get exact stats.**
  Window-sampled `/hits` (per-window top-N, right for Drilldown's visual exploration) was
  applied to any high-cardinality field; it is now gated on Drilldown OR a Grafana-sourced
  high-card field, so direct API clients and non-Grafana callers fall through to exact
  `stats_query_range` aggregation (bounded by `max-stats-query-series`).
- **Helm: corrected stale chart documentation** for the stats-series default and the
  peer-auth token wiring so the values reference matches the shipped behavior.

### Changed

- **Helm: `recent-tail-refresh-max-staleness` default lowered from 15s to 2s** to match
  the binary default, so live-tail Explore stays fresh out of the box on chart deployments
  (the 15s chart value previously exceeded the inner cache TTL and never bypassed).

## [1.61.0] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- `rules-migrate` now validates rule expressions with the typed LogQL AST validator
  before translation. Malformed LogQL — e.g. a `| drop level!=~"debug"` matcher, which
  the proxy's query handlers already reject with HTTP 400 — previously slipped through
  rule-file conversion with the broken stage silently skipped; it now fails conversion
  with the same Loki-style parse error.
- **LogQL parser no longer panics on an unterminated opaque function call.** A query
  such as `(A00000(` — an unknown/opaque metric function (`label_replace`, `label_join`,
  …) whose argument parentheses never close — made `consumeBalancedParens` return offset
  0, and the caller then sliced `input[start:0]` and panicked with "slice bounds out of
  range". Because `ValidateLogQL` runs on every `query`/`query_range` request (and now in
  `rules-migrate`), a crafted query could panic the parser; it now returns a Loki-style
  parse error. Found by fuzzing.
- **`| drop`/`| keep` matchers using the `!~` operator are no longer silently dropped.**
  `!~` is the only drop/keep operator with no `=`, and the matcher-vs-bare-field classifier
  in `walkDropKeepStages` gated on `strings.Contains(item, "=")`, so a `field!~"re"`
  conditional drop/keep was misread as a bare field name and lost during proxy
  post-processing. It is now parsed as a matcher condition like the other three operators.
  Found by the expanded drop/keep tests.

### Changed

- Expanded test coverage for the LogQL parser, translator, and `rules-migrate`: added
  table-driven and fuzz tests for drop/keep matcher classification (all four operators,
  malformed-form skipping), rule-expression validation (valid translation + malformed
  rejection, error identifies group/rule), and unterminated-paren parser robustness.
- Hardened the flaky `TestPeerCache_WriteThroughAndReadAheadBranches` test: it now waits
  on the client-side write-through counter (incremented after the peer records the push)
  instead of racing the server-side record against the counter, which intermittently
  failed under loaded CI.
- Removed the unused `translator.ValidateDropKeepSyntax` helper: malformed drop/keep
  matchers cannot reach the translator from any entry point now that both the query
  handlers and `rules-migrate` validate via the LogQL AST first. Added regression
  tests locking the HTTP 400 contract for `query` and `query_range`.

## [1.60.0] - 2026-06-11

### Changed
- Relocated the CI-consumed VL AST coverage registry (`vl-ast-coverage.json`) from
  `docs/` to `scripts/`, next to the checker script that reads it; the `docs/` tree
  now carries only documentation pages.

## [1.59.0] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- **Drilldown high-cardinality charts no longer cluster all data at one edge at 24h+.** Grafana's querySplitting emits a tiny trailing residual chunk (range < step); for a `count() by(field)` metric query that residual is a single-bucket, multi-series frame, and Grafana's `mergeFrames`/`closestIdx` collapses all N single-point series onto ONE edge of the merged chart — a right-edge spike, or a left-edge "all data at the beginning" cluster on the pod label / `*_id` field panels. The residual is now suppressed at the `query_range` entry (where the request URL still carries start/end/step and the original query still parses as a metric expression — downstream, `withOrgID`/`injectAuthFingerprint` reset `r.Form` and rewrite the URL, so deeper guards see an empty range), scoped to metric (matrix) expressions so log queries are never blanked. (Supersedes the 1.58.1 "axis-trim, blanking removed" change, which regressed this.)
- **Live-tail Explore now picks up new logs on refresh.** Near-now `query_range`/`query` responses are cached by `compatCacheMiddleware` for 5 minutes (for chart stability), and its cache-hit path had no freshness check — so refreshing a live-tail Explore (or a now-relative dashboard) re-served the cached page and showed no new logs, unlike the VictoriaLogs datasource which has no such cache. The cache-hit path now consults `compatCacheShouldBypassForFreshness`: for a request whose end is near now (within `-recent-tail-refresh-window`) and whose cached entry is older than `-recent-tail-refresh-max-staleness`, it re-fetches instead of serving stale; historical (not-near-now) queries keep the full cache. The `-recent-tail-refresh-max-staleness` default is lowered from 15s to **2s** so live tail stays fresh (it was also larger than the inner cache TTL, which is now additionally clamped in `shouldBypassRecentTailCache` as a safety net).

## [1.58.1] - 2026-06-08

### Security

- **Upstream transport errors no longer leak query parameters.** Go's `http.Client` surfaces dial / TLS / timeout failures as a `*url.Error` whose message embeds the full backend URL — including the LogQL/LogsQL query — so those errors could leak query content (potentially sensitive log selectors) into error logs and handler error responses, even though the debug *request* log already redacts the query. Transport errors are now passed through `sanitizeUpstreamError`, which redacts the URL query while preserving the underlying cause (status mapping and the circuit breaker still classify correctly). No-op under `-debug-log-raw-queries=true`.
- **Backend error bodies no longer leak query content into logs.** A VictoriaLogs `4xx`/`5xx` body can echo the translated LogsQL query (selectors, filter values) in its parse/error message; handlers passed those raw bodies to `writeError`/`writeDrilldownPartialFromUpstream`, which log them. All such sites now route through `redactBackendError`, the application-level analogue of `sanitizeUpstreamError`: it extracts VL's error message and strips query-like content (stream selectors, long quoted literals, long hex/id runs) and caps length. No-op under `-debug-log-raw-queries=true`.

### Fixed

- **Grafana querySplitting residual is now handled by per-chunk axis trimming, not blanking.** Grafana's 24h+ querySplitting emits a tiny trailing residual chunk; the proxy used to return an empty matrix for Grafana-sourced sub-step requests to avoid a right-edge `mergeFrames` spike, but that heuristic had false-positives — it blanked legitimate short-range / coarse-step dashboard queries. The windowed `/select/logsql/hits` path now trims each chunk's response to its requested `[start,end]` window (matching the direct stats path), so the residual contributes only its real data and no spike forms. The suppression gate is removed entirely, so no Grafana sub-step query is ever blanked.
- **High-cardinality `count() by(field)` window-sampling is now scoped to Drilldown or high-cardinality fields.** The window-sampled `/select/logsql/hits` path returns per-window-sampled top-N series rather than exact `stats_query_range` results — right for Drilldown's visual exploration and for high-cardinality fields (`trace_id`, `*_id`, …), but the wrong default for a normal dashboard panel over a low-cardinality field. It is now gated on Drilldown OR a high-cardinality field; normal Grafana dashboard/Explore low-card panels and direct API clients all get exact stats (bounded to `max-stats-query-series` top-N-by-count, like Loki's `max_query_series`).
- **Helm: metrics listener, Service, and ServiceMonitor can no longer render contradictory configs.** The deployment's metrics `containerPort` is now derived from `extraArgs.metrics-listen` (so the named Service/ServiceMonitor target always matches where `/metrics` actually serves), and the chart fails fast when `service.metrics.enabled=true` is combined with an empty `metrics-listen`, `server.register-instrumentation=false`, **or a loopback-bound `metrics-listen` (`127.x`/`localhost`/`::1`)** — the last renders cleanly but is unreachable from the pod IP the Service targets, so scrapes silently time out.
- **Helm: default NetworkPolicy now allows ServiceMonitor metrics scraping.** When `serviceMonitor.enabled=true`, the NetworkPolicy automatically opens the metrics port (derived from `metrics-listen`) for Prometheus — previously it only opened the proxy port 3100, so enabling the ServiceMonitor under the default NetworkPolicy silently timed out the `/metrics` scrape. Scope the scrape source with the new `networkPolicy.monitoringNamespace` (convenience — a namespace name) or `networkPolicy.monitoringFrom` (explicit `NetworkPolicyPeer` list); empty both leaves the port open (zero-config default, documented).
- **Cold-storage router refresh loop is now tied to proxy shutdown.** `ColdRouter.Start` ran its manifest-refresh goroutine on `context.Background()` and `Proxy.Shutdown` never stopped it, leaking a goroutine + HTTP client across proxy lifecycles (tests, embedding, rolling restarts). `ColdRouter` now owns a stop/done channel and a `Stop()` that `Shutdown` calls.
- **Ring-wide cache purge fanout is now concurrency-capped.** `purgePeerCaches` spawned one goroutine per peer; a large discovered ring could burst a request to every peer at once. The fanout is now bounded (`errgroup.SetLimit(16)`), preserving per-peer timeouts and partial-failure reporting.

## [1.58.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Ring-wide cache purge.** `POST /admin/cache/flush?peers=1` (or bare `?peers`) now purges the local instance's caches (L0 hot index + L1 memory + L2 disk) AND fans the purge out to every peer in the L3 ring, authenticated with the shared `X-Peer-Token` — the same auth the peer cache already uses for get/set/has. An operator clears the entire fleet's caches by hitting one admin-token-protected instance instead of curling each pod. The fanout is concurrent (5s per-peer timeout); an unreachable peer is reported in the JSON response (`"peers": {"addr": "error: …"}`), not fatal. A new peer-side endpoint `POST /_cache/purge` (gated by the peer-token middleware, served on the main listener like the other `/_cache/*` routes) receives the purge and clears that node's caches only — peers never re-fan-out, so there is no broadcast storm. Without `?peers` the endpoint is unchanged (local-only).

## [1.57.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **L0 hot-key index now surfaces as a cache tier in metrics.** New `tier="l0"` label on `loki_vl_proxy_cache_tier_requests_total`, `loki_vl_proxy_cache_tier_hits_total`, `loki_vl_proxy_cache_tier_misses_total`, and `loki_vl_proxy_cache_objects`. L0 is the bounded per-key hotness sidecar that drives peer hot-key read-ahead — it is NOT a lookup tier in the L1→L2→L3 chain. A "hit" means the key was already in the hot index (was hot before this request); a "miss" is the first observation of that key. `cache_objects{tier="l0"}` reports the current bounded population of the hot index. Both OTLP push and Prometheus `/metrics` paths emit the new series.
- **e2e-compat compose now exercises all four cache tiers end-to-end.** The main `e2e-proxy` is configured with `-disk-cache-path` (L2 bbolt on a named volume that survives `docker compose restart`) and joins a 3-node static peer ring (`-peer-discovery=static`) together with two new sibling services `loki-vl-proxy-peer-a` and `loki-vl-proxy-peer-b` exposed on host ports `13150` and `13151`. vmagent scrapes all three with distinct `instance=` labels so dashboards can disaggregate per-proxy cache stats.
- `scripts/bench-cache-tiers.sh` — measures each tier against the compose stack: `l1` (cold-vs-warm hit ratio), `l2` (L1→L2 promotion across `docker compose restart`), `l3` (cross-peer fetch from peer-a → peer-b), `long` (7d → 7d-1h windowed cache reuse). Prints before/after counter deltas per tier so the expected promotion path is verifiable.
- L0 series now appear alongside L1/L2/L3 in the bench-resources dashboard's hit-ratio, requests/sec, and objects panels.

### Fixed

- **High-cardinality Drilldown label/field panels (pod, `*_id`) now render correctly and fast at 24h+.** A `detected_level` filter combined with a `by(field)` aggregation on a churning, high-cardinality field (pod names, `trace_id`, `span_id`) previously returned ~142k uncapped single-point series at short ranges (flooding Grafana) or an empty matrix at 24h+ (the VictoriaLogs stats response exceeded the 16 MB body cap), and the panel rendered as a single right-edge spike. Three root causes were addressed: (1) the `detected_level` filter is now evaluated against VictoriaLogs' column-indexed `level` field instead of forcing a `| unpack_logfmt` re-parse of every line — ~64× faster (24h pod query 26s → ~0.6s; level-filtered field breakdowns now match the unfiltered baseline); (2) single-field `count() by(field)` over ranges ≥ 2h routes to the window-sampled `/select/logsql/hits` path so the returned series span the whole timeline instead of clustering the busiest short-lived values into a few buckets; (3) Grafana's 24h+ querySplitting residual chunk (a tiny trailing range ≤ 2× step that `mergeFrames` glued onto the main series as a spike) is now suppressed on every stats path, not just the `/hits` path. Low-cardinality panels and non-Grafana callers are unaffected.

## [1.56.2] - 2026-06-07

### BREAKING CHANGES

- **Binary admin endpoints now bind to loopback by default.** Previously `-server.register-instrumentation=true` and `-server.admin-auth-token=""` caused immediate startup failure. Now admin/debug routes are served on a dedicated `--admin-listen` (default `127.0.0.1:3101`) when no token is set; main `--listen` serves proxy traffic only. To restore the previous behavior, set `-server.admin-auth-token` to a value of your choice. Affected: operators running the binary without a token who relied on `:3100/admin/*` being reachable from outside the host.
- **`/metrics` is no longer served by default.** `-server.register-instrumentation` default flips from `true` to `false`. New `--metrics-listen` flag (default `""`) supports a dedicated listener. The chart now sets `register-instrumentation=true` and `metrics-listen=:9091` so ServiceMonitor / Prometheus scrapes keep working without operator action. Binary users who scrape `:3100/metrics` today must add `-server.register-instrumentation=true` (and optionally `--metrics-listen=:9091` for a dedicated port).
- **Peer cache requires a shared token by default.** When `--peer-discovery` is set and `--peer-auth-token` is empty, the proxy now refuses to start. To restore the previous IP-allowlist-only behavior, pass `--peer-insecure-ip-allowlist=true`. The Helm chart auto-generates a token Secret on first install if `peerCache.authToken` is unset, so chart users see no operational change.
- **Chart now enforces conservative request limits by default.** `extraArgs.max-concurrent` defaults from `0` (unlimited) to `64`. `extraArgs.rate-limit-per-second` from `0` to `50`, `extraArgs.rate-limit-burst` from `0` to `100`. To restore unlimited behavior, set all three back to `0` in your values file.

### Added

- `--metadata-default-lookback=12h` flag bounds `/labels`, `/label/{name}/values`, and `/series` requests when the client omits `start`/`end`. `0` disables (prior behavior).
- `--backend-version-strict=false` flag promotes the existing soft version check to a hard startup failure when set.
- `--host-proc-root` flag for the proxy binary, allowing host-scope and self-scope `/proc` reads to use different roots.

### Security

- Debug logs no longer include raw LogQL/LogsQL or backend query params by default. Each query is logged as `sha256:<8hex>+len=<n>`. To restore raw debug output, pass `--debug-log-raw-queries=true`.
- Peer-cache `X-Peer-Token` comparison upgraded from a plain `!=` check to `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`, closing a timing-side-channel on the shared peer token. Defense-in-depth alongside the new "token required by default" startup gate.
- Chart no longer mounts the host's entire `/proc` directory. Five specific system-wide counter files are mounted individually (`/proc/{stat,meminfo,pressure/cpu,pressure/memory,pressure/io}`). Per-process info for other workloads on the host is no longer reachable from the proxy container.

## [1.56.1] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- Eliminate the production data race in pattern auto-detection.
  `extractLogPatternsFromWindowEntriesWithStats` (postprocess.go:390) read
  `entry.Stream["detected_level"]` from a goroutine spawned at
  `query_range_windowing.go:235` while the main thread's `applyDerivedFields`
  (stream_processing.go:319) wrote into the SAME underlying map. Root cause:
  `applyStreamLabelMutations` returns `desc.translatedLabels` as an alias when
  no drop/keep change applies, so multiple entries from the same `_stream`
  within a window — plus the autodetect goroutine — shared one map with the
  derivedFields writer. Manifested in production as
  `fatal error: concurrent map read and map write` under Grafana log-volume
  histogram panels that fan out 3+ concurrent windowed sub-queries.
  Fix: `snapshotEntriesForPatterns` builds a fresh per-entry Stream map with
  only the two keys the autodetect path reads (`detected_level`, `level`)
  before spawning the goroutine. Cheap — no full descriptor-map clone — and
  breaks the alias completely. Race-detector verified by new
  `TestSnapshotEntriesForPatterns_RaceFreeUnderConcurrentMutation`.

### CI

- Add a dedicated `race-stress` PR-gating job that runs
  `go test -race -count=1 -timeout=8m` across `internal/{proxy,cache,middleware,observability}`,
  plus a targeted verbose re-run of the concurrent-regression tests
  (`TestSnapshotEntriesForPatterns_*`, `TestRequestSampler_ConcurrentShouldLogIsRaceFree`,
  `TestAsyncHandler_*`). Catches concurrency bugs at PR time instead of in
  production — the v1.55.1 race only surfaced under
  log-volume-histogram + derivedFields + autodetect, none of which the
  default unit-test pass exercised together.
- Add `FuzzExtractLogPatternsFromWindowEntries` to the fuzz-smoke matrix
  (`-fuzztime=12s` per PR). Targets the exact production crash site with
  adversarial timestamps, multibyte messages, control characters, and
  extreme limits.

## [1.56.0] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- `internal/observability/request_sampler.go`: data race on `errorBucket.count`.
  The busy-mode collapse decision (`return b.count == 1`) read `b.count`
  AFTER releasing `errBucketMu`, so a concurrent `ShouldLog` call could
  mutate it between unlock and the read. Detected by the `-race` build
  when running the new `request_sampler_test.go::TestRequestSampler_ConcurrentShouldLogIsRaceFree`.
  Fix captures `count := b.count` while the lock is held and returns
  the captured value.

### Tests

- Add unit tests covering previously-zero-coverage code in:
  - `internal/observability/async_handler.go` (`NewAsyncHandler`,
    `Handle`, `Stop` drain + idempotence, `WithAttrs`/`WithGroup`,
    end-to-end through `slog`, dropped-record counter).
  - `internal/observability/request_sampler.go` (quiet vs busy mode,
    error collapse, digest gating, counter reset, concurrent safety —
    the race in `Fixed` above was caught by this test).
  - `internal/memlimit/memlimit.go` (`Apply` with explicit/env-var/
    invalid-percent/no-cgroup branches; cgroup v1+v2 file readers;
    `applyGCPercent` env + explicit paths).
  - `internal/cache/cache.go` and `internal/cache/peer.go` (the
    `NewDisabled` constructor + `GossipHaveKey`, `SetPeerAZ`,
    `HasPeerHost` helpers — all 0 % before).
  - `internal/logsql/ast.go` (every `Pipe`, `FilterExpr`, and
    `StatsFunc` `String()` formatter that the existing baseline
    missed: 33 pipe stages, 4 stats funcs, 10 filter nodes; plus the
    package-internal marker-method invocations).
  - `internal/logql/ast.go` (same marker-method coverage pattern).
  - `internal/proxy/metric_agg.go` (`populationStddev`,
    `populationVariance`, `applyConstantBinaryOp`,
    `applyMatrixStddevAgg`, `applyInstantStddevAgg` — pure JSON-byte
    transformations and math helpers).
  - `internal/proxy/metric_binary.go` + `stream_processing.go`
    (`parseFloat64Bytes`, `abs64`, `extractStatsGroupByFields`,
    `applyDropConditions`, `applyKeepConditions`).
  - `internal/translator/translator.go` ip() helpers
    (`extractIPFilterArg`, `ipLineFilterToRegex`,
    `buildCIDRRegex`, `buildIPRangeRegex`, `buildIPv6CIDRRegex`) plus
    `ParseKeepConditions` — all 0 % before; translator package
    coverage jumps from 83.4 % to 88.2 %.
  - `internal/proxy` more pure helpers: `stripOuterLabelReplace`,
    `inferUnwrapConv`, `formatMetricSampleValue`, `metricWindowValue`,
    `patternLevelFromEntry`, `parsePatternStepSeconds`,
    `extractLevelFromMsg`.
  - `internal/cache/peer.go` request-body encoding/response-writing:
    `acceptsPeerEncoding`, `encodePeerRequestBody` (identity/zstd/gzip
    roundtrips + unsupported error path),
    `writePeerEncodedResponse` (zstd / gzip-fallback /
    no-supported-encoding branches), `peerPreferredSetEncoding`
    (cache package coverage 82.6 % → 84.5 %).

  Total: ~2200 lines of new test code, lifts aggregate Go coverage on
  `main` from 83.5 % to 84.8 % (+1.3 pp). Race-detector clean.

### Docs

- README architecture: collapse the 145-line `Detailed Architecture` mermaid
  (10 subsystems × 30+ nodes) into a single `How It Works` diagram with five
  boxes (client → Loki API surface → Smart layer → translator → VictoriaLogs).
  The Smart layer lists the five capabilities that actually distinguish the
  proxy (disk-backed label cache + keep-warm, progressive backfill,
  time-bucketed keys, fleet jitter + peer-first warmup, circuit breaker /
  rate limits / tenant isolation). Operator-grade per-box detail moves to
  `docs/architecture.md`. README shrinks from 586 to 437 lines and the
  redundant `High-Level Flow` diagram (which duplicated the same shape) is
  removed. Surface the project site (`reliablyobserve.github.io/Loki-VL-proxy`)
  as a prominent callout above the TLDR.

### Notes

- Finding #8 from the v1.55.0 review (size of `cmd/proxy/main.go` and `internal/proxy/proxy.go`) is tracked under the existing proxy architecture refactor plan and is intentionally out of scope here.
- One INFO-level access-log line in `internal/proxy/query_translation.go:158` still emits a truncated 200-char `loki.query` field for operator audit. This is intentional audit telemetry (not debug output) and is out of scope for this hardening series; tracked as a follow-up for the audit-log redesign.
- Integration test scenario 3 for `--metadata-default-lookback` exercises `/series` rather than `/labels` because `/labels` independently caps its synchronous backend window to 5 minutes (`metadataMaxFieldNamesWindow`), which would mask the lookback default in the assertion. The lookback default still applies to `/labels` via the background refresh path — only the synchronous test surface differs.

## [1.55.3] - 2026-06-06

### CI

- `test/e2e-compat`: warm the proxy's filtered label_values cache
  (`/loki/api/v1/label/<X>/values?query={...}`) in `ensureDataIngested`
  before the drilldown tests run. The proxy keeps THREE separate label
  caches — unfiltered values, the `/labels` LIST, and filtered values —
  and only the first two were being warmed. On hosted CI runners the
  filtered cache stayed empty for 30–60 s after the unfiltered cache was
  already hot, which flaked five Grafana resource subtests with
  `data:[]` responses (`additional_label_values`,
  `label_values_honor_limit`, `label_filters_apply_to_resource_values`,
  `multi_tenant_resources_respect___tenant_id___filters`, and
  `TestDrilldown_RuntimeFamilyContracts`). New `waitForProxyFilteredLabelValues`
  helper polls the filtered endpoint with a 60 s timeout for the two
  stream selectors the failing subtests exercise; total setup budget
  stays well under the 300 s test-suite timeout.

## [1.55.2] - 2026-06-06

### CI

- `scripts/ci/check_quality_gate.py` gains a per-benchmark `abs` threshold
  override table for the 7 micro-benches affected by the 1.55.0
  `holdBufPool` + `buildHitsRangeMetricMatrix` pre-size paths (QueryRange
  and Labels cache-hit / cache-bypass memory, allocs, ns). The pool's
  per-call overhead (~15 allocs / ~528 B / ~700 ns) is fixed regardless of
  response size — at micro-bench scale (192 B baseline) it shows as +275 %
  memory / +187 % allocations, but at production scale (MB responses,
  concurrent handlers) it amortizes to noise while the bounded-heap win
  is decisive (proven by `TestE2ELock_ProxyHeapBoundedUnderDrilldownLoad`
  and the `*_HeapStableUnder*` stress tests — all green with NEGATIVE
  heap deltas). Only the `abs` (per-call tolerance) is raised; `min_base`
  (noise floor) stays at default so a 25× regression still fails.
  Locked by `PoolOverheadOverrideTests` in
  `scripts/ci/tests/test_check_quality_gate.py`.

## [1.55.1] - 2026-06-05

### Docs

- README `One-glance comparison` + `Honest TLDR` + `Proxy heap behaviour` +
  `What this is and isn't` sections (~105 lines) trimmed to a single ~20-line
  `One-glance comparison` summary with the headline outcome / latency / CPU
  / RSS numbers + a link to the new `docs/honest-tldr.md`. The long-form
  per-query breakdown, methodology, heap-pool deep-dive, and tuning history
  moved verbatim to the docs page so they're discoverable from the
  Docusaurus sidebar (under "Cost & Comparison") and still findable from
  GitHub via the README link.

## [1.55.0] - 2026-06-05

### Performance

- Reduce proxy allocations by ~75%: stream VL NDJSON response instead of buffering
  with `io.ReadAll`, pool `TranslateLabelsMap` result maps via `sync.Pool`, pre-size
  `strings.Builder` in serialization paths, fast-path `SanitizeLabelName` for already-valid
  names, skip `compatCacheCapture` for non-cacheable requests, and pool keys slice +
  eliminate redundant map copy in `handleSeries`.
- Drilldown field queries: batch concurrent per-field `stats_query_range` calls into a
  single multi-field VL call, coarsen step to cap bucket count, skip high-cardinality ID
  fields for wide ranges, and gate fan-out with a semaphore to avoid thundering-herd.
- Background label refresh: fix `fieldMetaCacheKey` drift so the singleflight key is
  stable across Grafana auto-refresh ticks; eliminate 5–10 s `stream_field_names` scans
  for 6h/12h/24h windows by capping the metadata range to 15 minutes.
- `volume_range`: use `stats_query_range` for single-label queries to avoid the hits
  endpoint's unbounded response for high-cardinality labels (e.g. `pod`).
- `query_range` and `query` compat cache TTL set to 5 minutes (fixed) instead of
  `max(5min, step)`: eliminates visible right-edge chart gaps when step=1h (Drilldown 2d/7d
  field histograms) while still reducing VL calls 30× vs the original 10 s TTL.
- `labels` and `label_values` compat cache keys now bucket `start`/`end` to the same 5-min
  granularity as `detected_*` endpoints so repeated Grafana auto-refreshes within the
  same window produce stable keys and serve responses from the compat cache.
- Scale `detected_fields`, `labels`, `label_values`, and `detected_labels` inner cache
  TTLs proportionally to the requested time range (1h cap for 7d+ windows): historical
  Drilldown pages stop re-fetching metadata on every sub-minute cache miss.
- `field_names` (native VL column index) scan window widened from 5 min to 7 days so
  sparse fields (`trace_id`, `session_id`, `span_id`, `job_id`, `tx_id`) accumulate
  sufficient index hits to be promoted into `detected_fields` for long time ranges.

### Fixed

- `volume_range` for multi-tenant `__tenant_id__` target label now returns data: skip the
  `stats_query_range` fast path for synthetic `__`-prefixed labels that VL cannot group by
  natively and fall through to the hits endpoint which handles them correctly.
- `detected_fields` background cache refresh now picks up newly ingested parsed fields
  within the existing 20 s freshness window: reverted inner-cache time-bucketing in
  `detectedFieldsCacheKey`/`detectedLabelsCacheKey` so refresh calls get a cache miss and
  fetch live data from VL instead of serving the previously cached result.
- Drilldown Fields panels for high-cardinality fields at 24h+ ranges now render as
  top-N + remainder histograms instead of empty charts or 100k+ unique series. Route
  both label queries (`pod`, `k8s_pod_name`) and parser-stage field queries (`trace_id`,
  `span_id`, `request_id`, `session_id`, `ip`, etc.) through VL's `/select/logsql/hits`
  endpoint, which computes top-N values and an aggregate `__other__` series in a single
  call. Three issues that prevented `/hits` from being reachable: (1) the proxy passed
  Grafana's bare-integer step (`120`) directly to VL, which requires a duration suffix
  (`120s`); (2) the regex matching field existence filters required unquoted field names,
  missing the quoted form (`"k8s.pod.name":!""`) the translator emits for OTel attributes;
  (3) `extractStreamSelectorOnly` only recognised Loki-bracketed selectors (`{namespace="prod"}`)
  and skipped VL-native form (`namespace:="prod"`) produced by the translator.
- Explore now returns data for `sum by (X) (count_over_time(...))` queries at 24h+ time
  ranges. Previously the Drilldown `/hits` fast paths were gated behind the
  `X-Query-Tags: Source=grafana-lokiexplore-app` header, so Explore-source requests with
  the same query shape fell through to `stats_query_range`, hit the 16 MB response cap on
  high-cardinality fields (`pod`, `trace_id`, `*_id`), and returned an empty matrix. The
  source-tag gate is removed; any caller issuing the Drilldown-compatible query shape now
  benefits from the same top-N + sampled-windows path.
- Right-edge spike on Drilldown / Explore / dashboard panel field histograms above 24h is
  eliminated. Grafana's Loki datasource splits metric range queries at the 24h boundary
  (`oneDayMs` in `querySplitting.ts`) and merges chunk responses via `mergeFrames`. The
  proxy previously routed the 24h chunk through `/hits` (top-20 series) but the small
  leftover chunk (<6h) through `stats_query_range` with `| limit 500`, returning a totally
  different and much larger series set. `mergeFrames` unioned both, so the 500 chunk-2-only
  series rendered as a tall spike at the right edge of the chart, dwarfing the 24h chunk's
  distributed data. Three coordinated fixes:
  (1) the hybrid `/hits` path now runs for every range, not just `> drilldownHybridThreshold`,
  so each Grafana chunk returns the same top-N shape;
  (2) `proxyStatsQueryRangeDrilldownHits` detects the 1-bucket leftover chunk Grafana emits
  for ranges that aren't exact multiples of the 24h aligned step (chunk range ≤ 2 × step)
  and returns an empty matrix instead of a 16-series block of values all landing on the
  rightmost timestamp — that block was the source of the right-edge spike under
  `mergeFrames`;
  (3) suppression applies to ANY Grafana client (Drilldown via `X-Query-Tags`, Explore /
  dashboard panels via `User-Agent: Grafana/X.Y.Z` or any `X-Grafana-*` header), because
  `querySplitting` fires unconditionally for Loki-datasource metric queries regardless of
  which Grafana app issued them.
  Verified against the live stack with a Grafana-faithful chunking simulator: an
  exactly-24h split-into-2-chunks query produces 16 series evenly distributed across
  12 × 2h bins (`1 1 2 2 2 0 2 1 1 1 1 2`) and 7d into 8 chunks produces 112 series across
  14 × 12h bins (`10 8 9 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8`) — no spike at the right edge in either.

### Security

- Bump Go toolchain from 1.26.3 to 1.26.4 to resolve govulncheck vulnerabilities
  GO-2026-5037 (inefficient candidate hostname parsing in crypto/x509) reachable
  via `proxy.Proxy.ValidateBackendVersionCompatibility` and `logsql.JSONValuesTopK.String`.
  Updated in `go.mod`, `bench/go.mod`, `Dockerfile`, all `.github/workflows/`,
  `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/benchmarks.md`.

### Tests

- E2E label-values flakes on hosted GHA runners (`additional_label_values`,
  `label_values_honor_limit`, `label_filters_apply_to_resource_values`,
  `multi_tenant_resources_respect___tenant_id___filters`) fixed by calling
  VictoriaLogs' documented `POST /internal/force_flush` from `ensureDataIngested`.
  VL keeps recent ingest in in-memory buffers and only materializes the column
  index (which backs `/select/logsql/field_values`) on flush; without
  `force_flush`, hosted runners returned empty `label_values` for 10–30 s after
  push and flaked the entire `TestDrilldown_GrafanaResourceContracts` suite.
  Also adds `-inmemoryDataFlushInterval=1s` to VL in `docker-compose.yml` as
  defense-in-depth for any test path not flush-aware.
  Source: https://docs.victoriametrics.com/victorialogs/#forced-flush
- `parsed_only_fields_refresh_after_new_logs_arrive` polling deadline raised
  20 s → 30 s → 60 s → 120 s across iterations to absorb hosted GHA runner
  variance. 120 s exceeds the 90 s `detected_fields` TTL so even when the
  background refresh stalls the next poll is a hard cache-miss → fresh fetch.

### Benchmark

- `bench/drilldown-vs-loki.sh` now sends `X-Query-Tags: Source=grafana-lokiexplore-app`
  on every Loki direct call, matching what Grafana Drilldown actually emits.
  Loki's `pkg/querier/queryrange/limits.go::seriesLimiter.Do` detects this via
  `IsLogsDrilldownRequest()` and converts max-series-exceeded errors from
  HTTP 500 `too_many_series` into HTTP 200 with partial results + warning
  header — the correct user-visible behavior. Without the header the bench
  misrepresented Loki's actual behavior for real Drilldown traffic.
- `docs/benchmarks.md` gains a new "Drilldown / Explore — real Grafana queries
  vs Loki direct" section with measured numbers for `sum by (pod)`, `trace_id`,
  `service_version`, and `/detected_fields` at 1 h–7 d ranges, plus per-container
  resource consumption (Loki peaked at 15.8 cores / 7.9 GiB before erroring;
  proxy + VL together used ~5 cores / 1.6 GiB while serving all queries).

### Observability / infra

- `test/e2e-compat` now scrapes proxy / vmauth / Loki / VictoriaLogs `/metrics` into the
  existing VictoriaMetrics instance every 5 s via `vm-scrape.yml` (single-node VM
  `-promscrape.config`, no extra vmagent needed). VM port exposed on host as `18428`.
  Only the bench-hit proxy variant (`loki-vl-proxy-vmauth`) is scraped — the other
  variants share the `loki_vl_proxy_*` metric names and would double-count without
  per-variant labels.
- Grafana ships a provisioned `Bench: Drilldown vs Loki — resources, traffic, cache,
  latency` dashboard (`test/e2e-compat/dashboards/bench-resources.json`, 36 panels
  across 8 rows): component resources (CPU / RSS / Go heap / goroutines / GC / FDs);
  proxy client traffic; proxy cache behaviour; proxy latency distribution
  (P50 / P95 / P99 + backend + internal-op); proxy heap deep-dive (heap_alloc /
  heap_inuse / heap_idle / heap_released / sys / RSS together, plus mallocs vs frees
  rate and GC pressure); proxy throughput; VL backend; Loki backend; vmauth gateway.
  Grafana datasource catalogue gains a VictoriaMetrics Prometheus datasource for
  these queries.
- `test/e2e-compat` Loki container bumped 8 GiB → 12 GiB with `GOMEMLIMIT=10GiB` +
  `GOGC=80`. 8 GiB OOM-looped continuously (Loki idle alone consumed 7.6 GiB of stored
  bigParts), making every "Loki vs proxy" bench number unfair because Loki was
  crashing instead of running. The new budget lets Loki actually serve queries; the
  fair-bench numbers in README and `docs/benchmarks.md` come from this configuration.

### Performance (heap-pool follow-up, commit 2340928)

- `EncodeResponseBody` now uses a pooled `bytes.Buffer` (`encodeBodyBufPool`) with a
  4 MiB cap-trim on Put. Pre-pool, pprof showed 96 MB / 61 % of live heap in
  `bytes.growSlice` from the compat-cache encoded-variant path
  (`compatCacheMiddleware → CompressionHandlerWithOptions → bytes.Buffer.ReadFrom`).
  Each call now reuses a pre-grown buffer; the cap-trim ensures one 50 MB response
  can't permanently inflate the pool footprint.
- `compressedResponseWriter.buf` switched from a value `bytes.Buffer` (allocated per
  request) to a pooled `*bytes.Buffer` (`holdBufPool`) with explicit acquire / release
  lifecycle: `startCompression` and `startBypass` drain-and-release; `finish` has a
  safety-net deferred release; `Write` re-acquires if a stray write arrives after
  release. Caps the per-request hold-buffer cost under concurrent Drilldown traffic.
- `buildHitsRangeMetricMatrix` pre-sizes the per-series `values` slice to
  `(end-start)/step` instead of starting at cap 16. Pre-fix the 17 280-bucket cascade
  for a 24 h / 5 s step query allocated through ~10 doublings per series, attributing
  1.31 GB of cumulative allocations to this single line. One allocation per series
  now. Safety cap of 32 768 buckets guards against pathological step inputs.
- Stress + heap-bounded regression tests added: `TestEncodeResponseBody_PoolKeepsHeapBounded`
  (1 000 sequential 288 KiB encodes, asserts heap delta < 32 MiB),
  `TestEncodeResponseBody_PoolStableUnderConcurrency` (32×100 parallel, < 128 MiB),
  `TestEncodeResponseBody_LargeResponseDoesNotPinPool` (8 MiB then 1 000 × 4 KiB,
  verifies cap-trim), `TestCompressedResponseWriter_HoldBufPoolReleased` (release
  lifecycle smoke), `TestCompressedResponseWriter_HeapStableUnderRepeatedRequests`
  (1 000 handler calls, < 32 MiB), `TestBuildHitsRangeMetricMatrix_PreSizedValuesSlice`,
  `TestBuildHitsRangeMetricMatrix_HeapBoundedAcrossManyCalls` (< 16 MiB),
  `TestLock_BuildHitsRangeMetricMatrix_PreSizeConstantsExist`. All measured with
  signed `int64(after) - int64(before)` heap deltas — pre-fix this measured 300+ MiB,
  post-fix is consistently negative (pool freed memory mid-test).

### Fixed (Loki API parity, commit 8b9ff26)

- VL upstream 4xx / 5xx responses no longer leak through to Grafana clients on the
  Drilldown / metric stats path. Loki itself converts max-series-exceeded errors to
  `HTTP 200 + warnings:[...]` partial-results for Drilldown traffic
  (`pkg/querier/queryrange/limits.go::seriesLimiter.Do` gated on
  `IsLogsDrilldownRequest` → `X-Query-Tags: Source=grafana-lokiexplore-app`); the
  proxy now mirrors that for VL legitimately failing on shapes like
  `|json|trace_id!=""` at long ranges (parser-pipe row-scan limit). New helper
  `writeDrilldownPartialFromUpstream` emits a Loki-shape body with `warnings: [...]`
  (the field Grafana's Loki datasource and Drilldown plugin both parse from the
  body, verified against upstream source), `Warning` HTTP header, `Cache-Control:
  no-store`, and stamps the suppressed VL status/message in
  `X-Proxy-Upstream-Status` / `X-Proxy-Upstream-Error` for operator visibility.
  Non-Grafana clients (curl, internal tooling) still see the real upstream error.
  Locked by `TestLock_VLErrorsConvertedToPartialResults` (5 subtests: 502 / 503 / 500
  Grafana-sourced → 200 + Warning; 502 / 500 non-Grafana → pass-through).

### Locked / Hardened

- All 2026-06 Drilldown quality fixes are pinned by named `TestLock_*` regression tests in
  `internal/proxy/drilldown_regression_lock_test.go` (now 14 lock cases including the
  new `TestLock_VLErrorsConvertedToPartialResults` and
  `TestLock_BuildHitsRangeMetricMatrix_PreSizeConstantsExist`). Each test maps to a single
  invariant — routing source-agnosticism, `/hits`-for-all-ranges, leftover-chunk
  suppression, step normalisation, remainder-bucket drop, shared timestamp axis,
  VL-native selector extraction, quoted-dotted-field detection, source-detection helper,
  no-double-call stats fallback, `maxStatsQueryRangeBytes` bound, `drilldownHitsFieldsLimit`
  bound, VL error conversion contract, and matrix pre-size safety cap. A future PR that
  weakens any of these fails CI with a named lock and a "do not regress" comment pointing
  back at the original incident.
- `TestE2ELock_ProxyHeapBoundedUnderDrilldownLoad` (e2e) drives 30 concurrent workers ×
  60 s of Drilldown stats traffic against the live proxy and asserts
  `go_memstats_heap_inuse_bytes < 500 MiB` and `process_resident_memory_bytes < 800 MiB`
  scraped from the proxy's own `/metrics`. Pre-fix the same workload measured 1.4 GiB
  RSS peak; this test fails loudly if any of the three pool optimizations above are
  removed in a future PR.
- `test/e2e-compat/drilldown_chunked_merge_lock_test.go` adds two end-to-end locks that
  run against the live VL stack: `TestE2ELock_DrilldownChunkedMerge_NoRightEdgeSpike`
  embeds a port of Grafana's `mergeFrames + closestIdx + splice` algorithm and asserts the
  merged frame has no right-edge spike for 24h / 25h / 2d / 7d ranges with both
  Drilldown-source and Grafana-dashboard sources;
  `TestE2ELock_DrilldownChunkedMerge_LeftoverChunkSuppressed` asserts the proxy actually
  emits an empty matrix (header `X-Proxy-Drilldown-Path: hits-leftover-suppressed` or
  cached equivalent) for the leftover chunk Grafana sends at the trailing edge of a
  24h-aligned split. Total: 14 e2e lock subtests.
- `docs/compatibility-drilldown.md` documents the Long-Range Histograms contract and the
  "Do Not Regress" checklist that maps each invariant to its lock test.

## [1.54.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- E2E quality matrix test (`TestDrilldown_QualityMatrix`): seeds 1 200
  controlled log entries and measures bucket density, total count, and proxy
  latency for 5 field types × 7 time ranges. Reports metrics via `t.Logf`;
  never blocks CI except for hard regressions (empty `level` result, proxy 5xx).
- E2E Loki comparison test (`TestDrilldown_LokiCompare_FieldQuality`): seeds
  identical logs into both Loki and VL, then asserts that the proxy response
  matches Loki within ±15% count and ≥90% non-zero bucket coverage for
  low-cardinality fields.
- Architecture doc `docs/proxy/drilldown-quality.md` covering path selection,
  cardinality tiers, zero-fill implementation, and Loki parity methodology.
- `-translate-otel-attributes` flag (default: `true`, env `TRANSLATE_OTEL_ATTRIBUTES`). Gates the built-in `knownUnderscoreToDot` OTel semantic convention rewrite in the `ToVL()` query-direction translator. Set to `false` when VictoriaLogs stores OTel attributes with underscores (e.g., Vector / Promtail / Fluent-bit via `/insert/elasticsearch/_bulk`); custom `-field-mapping` rules and runtime-learned aliases keep working in both modes. Resolves empty results for multi-label queries containing known OTel names like `k8s_container_name` against underscore-storage backends.

### Fixed
- Drilldown field histograms now show a continuous line at quiet time periods
  instead of disconnected spikes. VictoriaLogs `stats_query_range` omits
  zero-count buckets; the proxy now fills them with `"0"` to match Loki's
  behaviour (`zerofillStatsMatrix` applied in both the short-range batcher
  and the long-range hybrid path).
- When `-translate-otel-attributes=false`, the `ToVL()` query-direction translator no longer rewrites entries in `knownUnderscoreToDot` to dotted form. `ResolveLabelCandidates` and the `resolveTargetLabelFields` fallback are gated on the same flag, so the dotted form is no longer added as a candidate or fallback when OTel translation is disabled. Previously the rewrite/fallback always fired when `-label-style=underscores` was active.
- Drilldown hybrid path (ranges >6h) no longer emits duplicate `detected_level` series alongside `level` series: the hybrid stats query now groups by only the requested field (e.g. `level`), bypassing the underscore-fallback expansion (`addUnderscorefallbackByLabels`) that was incorrectly applied to the hybrid's narrow-window stats_query_range. Previously, both `level` and `detected_level` groupings were sent to VL and the result was merged, causing Grafana to display phantom "Value" series for the unrecognised `detected_level` metric key.
- Drilldown hybrid path no longer passes results through `trimAndTranslateStatsQRFJ`, which was renaming `level` → `detected_level` (via `ensureDetectedLevel`) in stats metric keys. Grafana Drilldown reads the metric key by the exact field name it requested; renaming it broke the sparkline display for the `level` field on 12h+ ranges. VL's internal `__name__` column marker (`"__name__":"_c"`) is now stripped by the lightweight `stripVLStatsNameKey` regex before the response is returned.
- Drilldown hybrid path: field_values stubs (for values seen in the full range but absent from the recent stats window) now report a per-bucket-equivalent count (`totalHits × histStep / fullRange`) instead of the raw total. Previously the stub's inflated total count dominated the histogram y-axis, making recently-inactive field values appear far more frequent than active ones.
- Drilldown hybrid path now scans the full requested range for its `stats_query_range` tier instead of only a recent adaptive window (`rangeNs/8`). The adaptive-window approach caused different time ranges (12h, 24h, 2d) to render visually identical flat-bar patterns and created a visible two-range gap (uniform stubs followed by a histogram burst at the right edge). VL column-index stats queries are fast enough (<1s for 7d) that the partial-window optimisation was unnecessary. `adaptiveHistogramWindow` and `drilldownHybridMaxWindow` are removed.

### Changed
- Drilldown field-histogram series cap (500 series, two-phase fallback) is now gated behind the `X-Query-Tags: Source=grafana-lokiexplore-app` header that Grafana Logs Drilldown sets on every `query_range` request via `supportingQueryType`. Previously, the cap applied to any client whose query matched the Drilldown pattern, silently truncating results for Explore and direct API users. Requests without the header go through `proxyStatsQueryRangeDirect` and receive unfiltered results.

### Performance
- Drilldown hybrid path (ranges >12 h) issues one `field_values` + one
  `stats_query_range` per field request, covering the full requested range
  at ≤30 coarsened buckets. Different time ranges now produce different
  histograms (the previous adaptive window made 12 h and 48 h look identical).
- **Hybrid drilldown path for wide ranges (>12h)**: `proxyStatsQueryRangeDrilldownHybrid` uses a two-tier approach for time ranges above 12h. Tier 1: `field_values` over the full range (~30ms, O(column-index)) discovers all unique values and their total hit counts. Tier 2: `stats_query_range` over the full requested range at a coarsened step (≤30 buckets) provides accurate per-bucket histogram bars. The two results are merged: values present in stats keep their real per-bucket distribution; values present only in `field_values` (beyond the top-500 limit) get evenly-distributed stub bars across the full range. High-cardinality fields (`trace_id`, `span_id`, `*_id`, `*_uid`) skip Tier 2 entirely and return a pure `field_values` synthesis (~30ms regardless of range). Reports the chosen path in `X-Proxy-Drilldown-Path` response header (`hybrid/fv+full-range-stats`, `field_values_hc`, `field_values_stats_err`, `empty`). Before this change, the proxy returned an empty matrix for all fields on 12h+ ranges (the two-phase fallback ran but was capped to 500 series per bucket, making it effectively useless for wide ranges).
- **Drilldown field batching**: `drilldownFieldBatcher` coalesces concurrent per-field `stats_query_range` calls (Grafana Logs Drilldown fires one request per visible field simultaneously) into a single multi-field VL query `by(f1,f2,...,fN) count() as _c`, then marginalizes the combined result back into individual per-field Loki matrix responses inside the proxy. One VL scan replaces N scans, cutting VL CPU proportionally to the number of visible fields (typically 4–8). High-cardinality fields (`trace_id`, `span_id`, UUID-like names) bypass batching and route through the existing two-phase path. Configurable via `-drilldown-field-batch-window-ms` (collection window, default 25ms) and `-drilldown-field-batch-max-fields` (trigger threshold, default 6 fields). Concurrent batch VL calls are limited to 2 (independent semaphore).
- **Drilldown step coarsening**: `proxyStatsQueryRangeDrilldown` caps the effective bucket count to 200 by snapping the client-supplied `step` up to the nearest "nice" interval (2m, 5m, 10m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 3h, 6h, 12h) when the raw step would produce more buckets. For a 12h Drilldown with step=60s this cuts from 720 to 144 buckets per field query — a 5× reduction in VL data scanned. `drilldownStatsCacheTTL` raised from 60s to 5min and the cache key now uses the coarsened step, so Grafana panel-width drift (which changes step by a few seconds per resize) no longer causes cache misses.
- **Drilldown response cache (60s)**: `proxyStatsQueryRangeDrilldown` now caches the translated Loki matrix response for 60 seconds (keyed on orgID + LogQL + time range, with both `start` and `end` bucketed to 5-min to absorb Grafana's sliding window). The cache is checked before acquiring the concurrency semaphore so re-renders (Grafana ticks, filter interactions, second tab) are served with zero VL calls and consume no semaphore slot. On first load the semaphore still limits concurrent VL calls to 4; any re-render within 60s costs nothing. Bucketing both timestamps is essential: Grafana's "last N h" panel drifts `start` by ~30s on every refresh tick, producing a unique cache key each time if only `end` is bucketed.
- Eager two-phase for high-cardinality Drilldown fields: `proxyStatsQueryRangeDrilldown` now skips the direct-path VL attempt entirely when overflow is predictable before any byte is read — eliminating the read-and-reject cycle (up to 32 MB wasted read + VL scan CPU spike) for two cases: (1) known UUID/snowflake field names (`trace_id`, `span_id`, `*_id`, `*_uuid`, `*_token`, `*_hash`, `*_key`) detected by `isLikelyHighCardinalityField`; (2) any field previously observed to overflow, tracked in `drilldownCardinalityCache` (5-min TTL per `{orgID, base, field}`) so Grafana re-renders (filter/time-range changes) skip the direct attempt without another wasted round-trip. Eager two-phase is intentionally NOT triggered by query duration alone: two-phase Phase 1 scans all logs across the full time range (equivalent to K bucket-scans), making it more expensive than the direct path for fields with ≤500 unique values.
- Fix `warmLabelWindows` full-range VL scans: the keep-warm loop (`startLabelCacheKeepWarmLoop`) fires every 3.75min and calls `warmLabelWindows` for 4 time presets (1h/6h/24h/7d) across every proxy instance. Previously `warmLabelWindows` set `labelFullRangeFetchKey{}` to route to `field_names`, but that flag also bypasses `capMetadataStartOnly` (the 1h cap). So the 24h and 7d warmup queries scanned the full range (~700ms and ~1.5s per call). With 9 proxy instances in the e2e stack: 9×4 = 36 concurrent heavy VL queries every 3.75 minutes, spiking VL to full CPU (18 cores). Fix: remove `labelFullRangeFetchKey{}` from `warmLabelWindows`; the synchronous path's 1h cap applies, reducing each warmup call to ~20–30ms. The `refreshLabelsCacheAsync` background goroutines (triggered by actual user requests) still query the full historical range when users request wide windows.
- Fix `fieldMetaCacheKey` start-timestamp drift: `fetchStreamFieldNamesCached`, `fetchAllFieldNamesCached`, and `fetchPreferredLabelNamesCached` all use `fieldMetaCacheKey` to compute their cache key. The key bucketed `end` to 30s but left `start` raw. For Grafana's sliding "last N h" window both endpoints drift by the same real-time delta on every auto-refresh tick, so the cache key changed on every request — 219 `field_names` calls in 17 minutes instead of ~20. Now buckets both `start` and `end` to 30s. Same fix applied to the `refreshLabelsCacheAsync` singleflight key which had the same one-sided bucketing.
- Remove `| sort by (_time desc)` from `/select/logsql/streams` calls in `serviceNameValues` and `fetchNativeStreams`: the streams endpoint uses column-index lookups to enumerate unique stream label sets, but the sort pipe forced VL to load and heap-sort all matching log entries before grouping into streams — an O(N_logs) operation that OOM-ed on 12h+ ranges (`cannot calculate [sort by (_time desc)], since it requires more than 819MB of memory`). Stream discovery does not depend on log-entry ordering; the sort was unnecessary.
- Fix "no data" for high-cardinality Drilldown fields (`trace_id`, `span_id`, `session_id`, `duration_ms`) over 12h+ time ranges: VictoriaLogs applies `| limit` **per time bucket** (not globally). A 12h/60s query with `| limit 500` still produces 720 × 500 = 360,000 unique series (~32.8 MB) for short-lived UUID fields, which exceeded the 32 MB response cap. `proxyStatsQueryRangeDrilldown` now falls back to a **two-phase approach** when the direct-path response exceeds `maxDrilldownResponseBytes`: Phase 1 issues a single-bucket `stats_query_range` (step = entire range), making VL's per-bucket `| limit N` equivalent to a global top-N limit (~40 KB response); Phase 2 issues a standard range query with `field:in("uuid1","uuid2",...)` restricted to the Phase 1 values, bounding the response to ≤500 unique series (~80 KB) regardless of field cardinality. Step is never modified — changing the step breaks Grafana's timestamp alignment and causes "no data" for all fields. Matches Loki's `max_query_series` default (500).

## [1.53.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added
- `-default-max-query-length` flag enforces a global maximum query time range (0 = unlimited); per-tenant limits in `-tenant-limits` or `-tenant-default-limits` take precedence, so the flag acts as a safe fleet-wide ceiling
- `ParseError{Msg, Pos}` and `UnsupportedError{Msg, Func}` typed errors in `internal/translator`: HTTP handlers now discriminate error type to return `"parse error"` (400) vs `"bad_data"` (400) vs `"execution"` (500) Loki error envelopes instead of a flat string
- AST-to-AST translation layer in `internal/logql/translate.go`: typed `LogQuery → logsql.Query` mapper covers stream selector matchers (eq/neq/re/nre), line filters, parsers (json/logfmt/regexp/pattern), bare drop/keep, and simple `line_format` templates; unsupported nodes fall through via `errFallthrough` sentinel to the existing string translator, leaving metric/range/vector paths unchanged
- `TranslateOptions{LabelFn, StreamFields, Caps}` plumbing in the AST translator for future label-alias and capability-gated translation

### Performance
- Cap time range on `/select/logsql/streams` calls in `serviceNameValues` and `fetchNativeStreams` (used by `detected_labels`) to `metadataMaxFieldNamesWindow` (1h): wide Grafana windows (6h/12h/24h) were sending the full user range to the streams endpoint — an O(data-volume) scan taking 3–5s per call. Now capped at the most recent 1h, matching the existing cap on `fetchStreamFieldNamesCached`.
- Replace `stream_field_names` with `field_names` in service-name detection path (`serviceNameValuesFromNativeFields`): cold request drops from ~5s (4× stream_field_names at 1.25s each) to ~235ms (field_names 29ms + stream_field_values per field). Cache hits drop to ~12ms after the first request within a 30s window.
- Replace `stream_field_names` with `field_names` for background label refresh (`refreshLabelsCacheAsync`): the full-range path (triggered on wide Grafana windows: 6h/12h/24h) was sending the full user-requested range to `stream_field_names` — an O(data-volume) scan taking 5–10s. Now uses `field_names` (O(index), ~30ms at any range) for the background path, keeping `stream_field_names` (1h-capped) for the synchronous labels endpoint where strict Loki label-only semantics apply.
- Fix cache key drift in `fetchPreferredLabelNamesCached` and service-name detection: Grafana's sliding time window causes the `end` timestamp to drift a few seconds per request, producing a unique cache key on every click and defeating the 30s TTL cache. Now uses `fieldMetaCacheKey` with 30s end-timestamp bucketing so all requests within the same window share one cache entry.

### Changed
- `Proxy` struct decomposed into `Deps` (external dependencies), `HandlerConfig` (immutable flag-derived config, 83 fields), and `State` (mutable runtime state with pointer-typed mutexes/atomics); `Handler{Deps, Cfg, State}` type defined and wired in `New()` with live pointer sharing so Handler and Proxy see the same lock and map instances
- `RegisterRoutes` dispatches via named `routeHandler` method instead of anonymous closure
- Helm `values.yaml` updated with commented-out `default-max-query-length` entry

### Performance
- `SanitizeLabelName` fast-path skips allocation for already-valid label names; dead-code branch removed and covered by tests
- `strings.Builder` in hot response serialisation paths pre-sized with `Grow` to avoid append chain-realloc
- `compatCacheCaptureWriter` struct pooled via `sync.Pool` to cut per-request allocation on non-cacheable paths
- Window-range cache serialisation replaced `encoding/gob` with `encoding/json`, halving round-trip CPU and removing reflect overhead
- `TranslateLabelsMap` gains `TranslateLabelsMapInto` variant for caller-controlled result-map pooling; original wrapper unchanged
- `handleSeries` pools the per-stream keys slice via `sync.Pool`, eliminating one alloc per log stream on the hot ingest path
- Coalescer body buffer pooled via `sync.Pool` (`readBodyPooled`); replaces per-request `io.ReadAll` allocation with a reused 64 KB buffer
- Use `field_values` instead of `stream_field_values` for label value lookups on VL v1.50+: on v1.50+ stream fields are indexed in the column store so both endpoints return identical data, but `field_values` is ~20x faster (300ms vs 6s at 12h range for `label/service_name/values`). Older backends (v1.30–v1.49) keep `stream_field_values` with the existing 6h cap.
- Fix `query_range` cache key drift: Grafana's sliding `now-12h to now` window increments `end` by a few seconds on every panel refresh, causing every `stats_query_range` fan-out call to cache-miss and hammer VictoriaLogs with 20+ concurrent 2–22s metric queries. `queryRangeCacheKey` now buckets `end` to the step granularity (minimum 5 minutes) so consecutive Grafana refresh ticks (every 60s) share one cache entry and VL is queried at most once per 5-minute bucket — reducing steady-state VL CPU by ~5x for the Drilldown Fields page.
- Add `-stats-query-range-concurrency` flag (default 4) to cap the number of concurrent `stats_query_range` calls to VictoriaLogs. Grafana's Drilldown Fields page fires ~30 of these in parallel; without a cap they all land on VL simultaneously, peaking CPU at 30× per-query cost. With a cap of 4, at most 4 VL scans run at once — peak CPU drops ~7× and VL remains responsive. Configurable via Helm `stats-query-range-concurrency`. The proxy queues excess calls and serves them as slots free; client-cancelled requests abandon their slot cleanly via `ctx.Done()`.
- Fix `compatCacheKey` end-time bucketing for `query_range` and `query` endpoints: the compat cache key used `r.URL.RawQuery` verbatim, so Grafana's sliding `now-12h to now` window (drifting `end` by a few seconds on every refresh) produced a unique key on every panel refresh — bypassing the compat cache entirely. The key now buckets `end` to the same 5-minute granularity as `queryRangeCacheKey`. On the second and subsequent Drilldown Fields page refreshes within a 5-minute window, all ~30 parallel field queries are now served from the compat cache (~0ms) instead of re-hitting VL (1.5–7.6s each).
- Cap `stats_query_range` series in `collectRangeMetricHits` to `max-stats-query-series` (default 5000, configurable via `-max-stats-query-series` flag and Helm): high-cardinality `by()` clauses (e.g. 670k unique pod names over 12h) cause VL to return 50+ MB of data that the proxy previously parsed and re-serialized in full, taking 30+ seconds. Capping to 5000 series (matching Loki's `max_query_series` default) reduces Drilldown Fields response time from 32s to ~3.7s (VL 1.4s + proxy 2.3s) with a 700 KB response instead of 95 MB.
- Replace `streams` scan with `stream_field_names` + parallel `field_values` in `detectNativeLabels` on VL v1.50+: `detected_labels` (used by Drilldown's Labels/Fields panels) dropped from ~1400ms to ~620ms cold (2.3x) by replacing the O(stream-scan) `/select/logsql/streams` call with a cached `stream_field_names` call (~300ms) and 15 parallel `field_values` lookups (~60ms each, column index). Warm path is 3-13ms (served from the existing `detected_labels` cache).
- Use `field_values` instead of `stream_field_values` in `serviceNameValuesFromNativeFields` fan-out on VL v1.50+: 16 parallel field-values calls that used `stream_field_values` (700ms each at 1h) now use `field_values` (37ms each). For the `label/service_name/values` cold path this drops from ~24s to ~160ms.
- **Drilldown burst coalescer**: groups concurrent per-field `count_over_time` queries from Grafana Drilldown Fields into a single fused VL `count() if (field:*)` conditional-stats call, reducing ~30 VL round-trips to 1 per refresh; `| json` / `| logfmt` pipes are stripped before the fused query so VL's pre-indexed columns answer field-presence checks without full log parsing; configurable via `--drilldown-burst-window-ms` (default 50ms) and `--drilldown-burst-max-fields` (default 30)

## [1.51.0] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed
- Eliminate potential RWMutex deadlock in metrics handler: nested RLock in `cacheStatsSnapshot()` could deadlock when a writer queued between acquisitions; replaced with direct function-pointer call that does not re-acquire the lock
- Peer cache `/_cache/set` now rejects payloads exceeding `maxPeerSetBodyBytes` instead of silently truncating via `io.LimitReader`
- `| keep field=value` matcher form now applies to stream labels (not just structured metadata and parsed fields), matching the existing `| drop field=value` stream-label path
- Peer host authentication uses O(1) map lookup instead of O(n) linear scan of the peer list
- Synchronous label-metadata backend calls preserve the original query end time instead of bucketing it, improving freshness for recent data
- Drilldown compat e2e tests poll for VL label index readiness before asserting, fixing intermittent failures on slow CI runners

### Changed
- GHCR badge workflow scrapes public GitHub package pages instead of Docker Hub API
- Docs audit: api-reference.md adds missing health/cache/peer endpoints, observability.md fixes stale peer-cache metric names, compatibility-loki.md updated to 555+ parity cases

## [1.50.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- Correct misleading "proxy gap" comment on `unpack_filter`/`unpack_status_filter` e2e tests — the translator correctly emits `| unpack_json | filter ...`; the tests remain skipped only because the e2e test data is plain JSON (not `pack()`-format), which Loki's `| unpack` requires

## [1.50.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- `GET /_cache/has?keys=k1,k2,...` peer endpoint: lightweight batch key-presence check returning JSON `{key: {ok, ttl_ms}}` per key with no value data transferred — enables informed peer selection based on cache freshness
- `GET /_cache/peers` diagnostic endpoint: returns the current peer ring as `{"peers":[...],"self":"...","count":N}` — useful for verifying discovery is working correctly without inspecting logs
- `srv` peer discovery mode (`-peer-discovery=srv -peer-srv=_service._tcp.domain`): resolves peers from DNS SRV records which embed port numbers. Compatible with Kubernetes StatefulSet headless services, Consul DNS, CoreDNS, and any SRV-capable resolver. Inherits readiness gating from the DNS layer.
- `http` peer discovery mode (`-peer-discovery=http -peer-http-url=...`): polls an HTTP endpoint every `DiscoveryInterval` and parses the JSON response into a peer list. Auto-detects four response formats: simple string array, `{"peers":[...]}`, Prometheus HTTP SD (`[{"targets":[...]}]`), and Consul catalog (`[{"ServiceAddress":"...","ServicePort":N}]`). Works with Consul, Nomad, and custom registries outside Kubernetes.
- Translator unit tests for `| unpack`, `| unpack | method="GET"`, and `| unpack | status >= 400` — confirm correct VL translation without a live stack
- `TestParseAllLabelReplaceMarkers` unit tests covering single marker, chained two-level `label_replace(label_replace(...))`, and no-marker pass-through — the chained case was previously only validated via e2e; now covered as a unit test
- `TestFieldFilterMigration` extended with `json alias then filter` case: `| json http_code="status" | http_code="200"` → `| unpack_json | filter status:="200"` verifying the proxy's alias-rewrite path that fixed `json_field_alias_then_filter` parity

### Performance
- Time-bucketed cache keys align response cache entries with Grafana's `$__interval` rounding and VL's `split_interval` middleware, reducing redundant backend queries on repeated dashboard refreshes by up to 80%
- Label warmup on fleet restart is now two-phase: (1) one `/_cache/has` request per peer covering all window keys (metadata only, no data transferred); (2) targeted `/_cache/get` from the peer with the highest remaining TTL per key. For a 9-peer fleet with 4 windows this reduces peer network round-trips from up to 36 to at most 13 while routing each fetch to the freshest peer
- `-warmup-max-jitter` flag spreads fleet startup warmup across a configurable random window; combined with 500ms inter-window sleep this prevents all instances from issuing simultaneous wide-range VL queries on rolling restarts
- Peer-first warmup: instances that start later pull label windows from peers that already warmed them, so only the first instance to reach each window hits VL
- Label-values requests now use `field_names` (0.25 s) instead of `stream_field_names` (7–8 s) for VL field candidate resolution — ~30× faster; `stream_field_names` is retained only for the labels-keys, volume, and target-label paths where stream-index semantics are required
- Label-values requests already used `field_values` (0.35 s) instead of `stream_field_values` (7–9 s) — ~19× faster
- `field_names` backend calls for candidate resolution are now capped to the most recent 1 h of the requested range; wide dashboard ranges (24 h, 7 d) no longer trigger full-range field-name scans
- `field_values` backend calls are capped to the most recent 6 h; the first label-values load for wide time ranges now has bounded latency regardless of interval size
- Response cache keys for label/metadata endpoints bucket timestamps into 5-min/1-h/6-h intervals (matching Grafana's browser-side rounding and Loki's split-interval queryrange middleware) — repeated dashboard refreshes at slightly shifted timestamps now share a single cache entry
- `capMetadataTimeRange` now also buckets the params sent to VictoriaLogs so VL receives identical timestamp pairs from all equivalent queries
- Proxy startup pre-populates the label cache for common Grafana time presets (Last 1h, 6h, 24h, 7d) via a background goroutine, eliminating cold-start latency on first dashboard load
- Label cache entries are persisted to disk (shared read cache) and reloaded on restart, giving fast warm-start from the last known state within TTL
- Progressive two-stage label fetch: the synchronous path caps VL to 1h for immediate response; a background goroutine fetches the full requested range (up to 7d) so subsequent requests have complete historical label data
- Keep-warm loop runs every 90s and refreshes any label cache window with <60s TTL remaining, ensuring labels stay hot even with zero user queries

## [1.43.0] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed
- Circuit breaker no longer trips on HTTP-level 4xx errors from VL (invalid queries, ip() filter rejections, unsupported syntax) — only transport failures count toward the failure threshold
- `validateQuery` rewrite result is now applied to downstream requests; `rewriteQuantilePhiGT1` and future query rewrites now take effect in `query_range` and `query` handlers
- `| json alias="field"` alias→original field mapping tracked and applied to subsequent filter stages before translation, fixing empty-result mismatch for `| json http_code="status" | http_code="200"` queries
- `rate()` with `__error__` label filter inside range vector now returns 400 matching Loki's rejection (previously forwarded to VL causing divergence)
- `| line_format` with unclosed Go template action (e.g. `"{{.method"`) now returns 400 matching Loki's parse error
- `<>` diamond operator in label filters now returns 400 matching Loki's rejection
- `quantile_over_time` phi > 1.0 clamped to 1.0 so queries succeed rather than returning VL 422
- VL error bodies (e.g. `{"error":"...","errorType":"unavailable"}`) are now rewritten to Loki-compliant format — only the `"error"` message field is extracted; the proxy maps HTTP status codes to Loki `errorType` strings so Grafana receives well-formed error responses
- `count_over_time`, `rate`, `bytes_over_time`, `bytes_rate` with parser stages and range==step (tumbling window, e.g. `$__auto`) now always route to VL `stats_query_range` — previously required explicit `| drop __error__` to avoid the 1M-limit raw log fetch that caused OOM failures on >12h ranges
- `count_over_time`, `rate`, `bytes_over_time`, `bytes_rate` with parser stages and range>step (sliding window) now route to VL `stats_query_range` for O(buckets) aggregation with client-side sliding window, eliminating OOM for long-range queries like `bytes_over_time({...} | json [5m])` over 24h

### Added
- Multiple `| unwrap` stages in a range vector now detected and rejected with 400 (matching Loki 3.7.1 parse error)
- `| distinct` pipeline stage now rejected with 400 (not supported in LogQL 3.7.1)
- IPv6 ip() line filters (`::1`, `2001:db8::/32`, `::ffff:...`) accepted and translated via `net.ParseIP`/`net.ParseCIDR` validation
- Exhaustive LogQL parity test suite expanded to 312 cases covering ErrorParity, QueryParity, and KnownGaps categories
- Regression tests for VL error format compliance (`TestVLError_OOMBodyIsRewritten`, `TestExtractVLErrorMsg`) and long-range metric query routing (`TestLongRange_CountOverTimeUsesStats`, `TestLongRange_BytesOverTimeUsesStats`)

## [1.42.0] - 2026-05-24

### Performance
- Remove redundant proxy-side Go CIDR filtering (`ipFilterStreams`) — VL now handles `ip()` filters natively
- Hoist 9 per-request `regexp.MustCompile` calls to package-level vars in the translator, eliminating repeated regex compilation on every query
- Hoist `parseIPFilter` regex to package-level var in `internal/proxy/postprocess.go`, eliminating per-call compilation

### Changed
- `translatePipelineStage` now emits VL-native `ipv4_range()` (v1.45+) or regexp fallback for bare `| ip("cidr")` pipeline stages using capability-aware `logsql.Builder.BestIPv4Range`
- `translateSingleLabelFilter` now emits VL-native `ipv4_range()` for `label = ip("cidr")` filter expressions; proxy-side `ipFilterStreams` post-processing removed
- Non-unwrap stats path migrated to `logsql.PipeStats`; rate math pipe migrated to string concatenation (preserving VL `as` alias syntax)
- `buildStatsQuery` now uses `logsql.PipeStats` for by-clause assembly instead of `fmt.Sprintf` string construction; fix `pipeStatsString` to correctly omit `as` clause for empty alias
- `applyOuterAggregation` now uses `logsql.PipeStats` + `logsql.DeferredExpr` for stats expression construction instead of `fmt.Sprintf`
- Clarify `unwrapInnerGrouping` doc comment: function returns by-labels string for `buildStatsQuery`, not stats assembly
- Replace misleading `TODO(ast-migration)` comments on `tryTranslateSubquery`, `translateStatsResponseLabelsWithContext`, and `fetchBareParserMetricSeries` with accurate constraint descriptions; document specific blockers for the ip() native VL filter migration

### Documentation
- Add translation pipeline Mermaid diagram to `docs/architecture.md` showing the LogQL→LogsQL two-tier translation flow
- Update main runtime-paths and request-path diagrams in `docs/architecture.md` to reflect the typed AST/builder layer
- Update "Translator" subsection text in `docs/architecture.md` to describe both translation tiers
- Add "How it works (TLDR)" collapsible section to README explaining the parse→translate→build pipeline

## [1.41.0] - 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **Proxy and translator migrated from regex to typed AST nodes**: Replaced `fmt.Sprintf` label filter string construction with typed `logsql.FieldFilter{}.String()` nodes for guaranteed correct quoting. Consolidated 5 near-identical drop/keep pipeline walkers into a single `walkDropKeepStages` helper (~90 LOC removed). Replaced hand-rolled brace-matcher in `streamSelectorPrefix` with `logqlpkg.ParseLogQuery().Selector.String()`. Replaced 4 regex-based parser-detection functions with logql AST type-switches (regex fallback retained for unparseable queries). Replaced regex-based strip-stage functions in `drilldown.go` with `filterPipeline` + AST predicate helpers. Migrated `isStatsQuery` 20-line quote-aware scanner to `logsql.Parse()` + type-switch. Added `parseBareParserMetricCompatSpecAST` path using logql `RangeAggregation` node (regex fallback for Grafana template windows). Uses typed `PipeSort`, `PipeFormat`, `PipeDecolorize`, `PipeUnpackJSON{From}`, `PipeUnpackLogfmt{From}` nodes throughout.
- **`QuoteValue` and `QuotePattern` exported from `internal/logsql`**: Available for use by external consumers of the LogsQL AST.
- **`From` field added to `PipeUnpackJSON` and `PipeUnpackLogfmt` AST nodes**: Supports `| unpack_json from field` and `| unpack_logfmt from field` LogsQL constructs.

### Fixed

- **LogQL parser preserves whitespace in compound label filters**: `consumeRestOfStage()` now inserts spaces at word/number token boundaries so `| status>=200 and status<300` round-trips correctly through the AST instead of producing `| status>=200andstatus<300`. Affects all code paths that reconstruct query strings via `LogQuery.String()` (drilldown filter, metric fast-path, parser-stage stripping).

## [1.40.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **`internal/logsql` package**: typed LogsQL AST, recursive-descent parser, capability-aware `Builder`, and scanner for VictoriaLogs queries. Covers all 48 pipe stages, 29 stats functions, and 30+ filter types tracked by the upstream VL source tree — achieving 0 coverage gaps. `Capabilities` struct and `CapabilitiesFor(semver)` map VL versions to available features, enabling version-gated query construction via the `Builder` API (`BestTopN()`, `BestIPv4Range()`). Includes 363 tests across 7 files, a VL-HTTP compatibility test suite (`vl_compat` build tag), and a weekly CI coverage-check workflow (`vl-ast-coverage.yml`) that auto-detects new upstream VL constructs via `scripts/check-vl-ast-coverage.py`.

### Fixed

- **GHCR badge workflow hardened against empty API outputs**: `checkout@v6` → `checkout@v4` (v6 does not exist); shell defaults prevent empty `GITHUB_OUTPUT` values; Python `fmt()` handles empty string instead of causing `SyntaxError`.

## [1.39.0] - 2026-05-23

### Performance

- **Remove parser-stage guard from metric fast-path**: `rate`, `count_over_time`, `bytes_rate`, and `bytes_over_time` queries with `| json` or `| logfmt` pipeline stages now use VL native `stats_query_range` on tumbling windows (range == step) instead of the slow raw-log-fetch path.

### Fixed

- **`topk`/`bottomk` post-filtering**: `topk(K, expr)` and `bottomk(K, expr)` queries now return at most K series. Previously the translator stripped the wrapper and all series were returned unfiltered.

### Added

- **Dynamic GHCR pull count badges**: README now shows live download counts for the proxy image and Helm chart image, updated daily via GitHub Actions.

## [1.38.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Typed LogQL parser and AST model layer** (`internal/logql`): full recursive-descent parser replacing the regex/marker-based LogQL handling. Typed AST covers stream selectors (including backtick-quoted label matchers), all pipeline stage variants, range/vector aggregations, `@ modifier`, `bool` comparator, `| pattern`/`| regexp` with double-quoted strings, and `ip()` address validation — with full `String()` round-trip serialisation. `ParseAndValidate()` provides a lightweight syntax gate for request handlers. `Translate()` converts the AST to LogsQL via the existing translator. Unknown functions (e.g. `label_replace`, `label_join`) are captured as `OpaqueMetricExpr` nodes and passed through unchanged. A fuzz target ensures `Parse+String+Translate` never panic on arbitrary input. Bounded `sync.Map` validation cache eliminates per-request AST allocations.
- **`extractQuery` proxy helper**: pure function in `internal/proxy/query_extract.go` that validates the `query` form parameter using the typed parser; available for incremental adoption across request handlers.
- **Proxy routing via AST type-switches**: `handleQueryRange` and `handleQuery` now dispatch subqueries, binary ops, and range aggregations via typed `Expr` switches instead of regex pattern matching.
- **116-case exhaustive LogQL parity test machine**: `TestLogQL_Exhaustive_QueryParity` and `TestLogQL_Exhaustive_ErrorParity` verify result shape (resultType + series count) against Loki for all supported query forms across 16 categories (stream selectors, line filters, parsers, metric queries, binary ops, subqueries, offset modifier, unwrap, field-specific parsers, named regexp groups, vector matching, complex pipelines, edge cases). Total test count: 3,328.

### Fixed

- **`| distinct` stage correctly rejected**: Previously passed through to VL which does not support it; now returns HTTP 400 with a descriptive error, matching Loki's validation.
- **Invalid regex in stream selectors rejected**: `{app=~"[invalid"}` now returns an error at parse time instead of being forwarded to VL.
- **`rate_counter` without `| unwrap` rejected**: Correctly returns a parse error, matching Loki's requirement.
- **JSON error response format**: Validation errors now return `{"status":"error","errorType":"bad_data","error":"..."}` matching Loki's error shape instead of plain text.
- **Mixed-offset binary expressions no longer incorrectly rejected**: `sum(rate([5m] offset 1h)) / sum(rate([5m]))` now works — the proxy evaluates each side independently, matching Loki's behavior. Previously, the proxy rejected any expression where offset appeared on one side but not the other.

## [1.37.2] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **Helm chart: remove invalid `backend-read-buffer-size` / `backend-write-buffer-size` flags** ([#391](https://github.com/ReliablyObserve/loki-vl-proxy/issues/391)): The chart shipped two `extraArgs` flags that do not exist in the binary, causing startup failure with `flag provided but not defined`. Also removed invalid commented `disk-cache-encryption-key`. Added 19 previously undocumented Go flags to `values.yaml` for full 1:1 parity.

### Added

- **Helm ↔ binary flag parity CI gate**: Go tests (`TestHelmExtraArgsFlagParity`, `TestHelmExtraArgsCoverage`) and a rendered-template validation script (`validate_helm_flags.sh`) now run in CI. Any new flag added to Go without a `values.yaml` entry (or vice versa) will fail CI.

## [1.37.1] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- **Bare `| drop field` / `| keep field` now mutates stream labels**: Added `ParseBareDropFields`, `ParseBareKeepFields`, and `applyBareFieldMutationToStreamLabels`. Both streaming and buffered response paths now remove bare-dropped fields from the stream label set and filter stream labels to only kept fields, matching Loki behaviour. Label translation (underscore↔dot) is applied when running with `-label-style=underscores`.
- **Malformed drop/keep matchers return HTTP 400**: `ValidateDropKeepSyntax` now walks the pipeline and returns a parse error for any `| drop` / `| keep` item that contains `=` but uses an unsupported operator (e.g. `!=~`). Previously these were silently skipped.

### Performance

- **Multi-tenant fanout is now parallel**: Replaced the serial tenant loop in `multitenant.go` with concurrent goroutines (`sync.WaitGroup`); tenant sub-requests run in parallel, results merged in original index order for deterministic output.
- **Backward cold merge read bounded to `limit` lines**: Replaced unbounded `io.ReadAll(coldResp.Body)` with `readAndReverseNDJSON(r, limit)` which reads at most `limit` NDJSON lines via a ring buffer before reversing, preventing unbounded memory growth for large cold responses.

## [1.37.0] - 2026-05-21

### Documentation

- **Full docs refresh against v1.36.3**: All documentation updated to reflect current proxy features — translation reference (bare vs matcher drop/keep forms, stream label scope caveat), configuration (env vars, flags), getting-started (version), operations (tenant routing strategies, SIGHUP hot-reload, health endpoints), security (mTLS flags, require-tenant-header), performance (klauspost/compress, zstd window cache, loopback auto-detect), scaling (adaptive parallelism, peer discovery), architecture (cold storage routing and boundary table), compatibility pages (count_values error, emit-structured-metadata, backend-compression loopback, 3-tuple metadata format, categorize-labels), API reference (/alive, /healthz), roadmap, and README.
- **Helm chart documentation**: Added `charts/loki-vl-proxy/README.md` with full values reference, and three example Helm values files (`single-instance.yaml`, `production-ha.yaml`, `multi-tenant.yaml`) under `examples/helm/`.
- **`metadata-field-mode` default corrected**: Docs previously stated the default as `hybrid`; corrected to `translated` to match `cmd/proxy/main.go`.
- **KNOWN_ISSUES updated**: Added three current limitations (matcher scope for drop/keep, serial multi-tenant fanout, backward cold merge buffer) and documented three recently resolved issues (absent_over_time, sort/sort_desc, cold storage).

## [1.36.3] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- **`| drop` stream label fix under `label-style=underscores`**: `applyDropConditionsToStreamLabels` now translates the drop condition's Loki underscore field name (e.g. `service_name`) back to its VL dot-style raw key (e.g. `service.name`) via the label translator, so `| drop service_name="api"` correctly removes the stream label when the proxy runs with `-label-style=underscores`.
- **`| keep field=value` per-entry conditional semantics**: Added `ParseKeepConditions` and `applyKeepConditions`; the proxy now strips a kept field from entries whose value does not match the keep condition, implementing Loki-equivalent per-entry behaviour instead of unconditional field projection.
- **`!=~` invalid drop/keep matcher operator rejected**: `parseDropMatcher` now returns false immediately for `!=~` (scanned first to prevent `=~`/`!=` from matching within it); `splitDropSpec` and `translateKeepStage` skip items that look like matchers with unsupported operators rather than passing them through as malformed bare field names.

### Security

- **`ws` dependency in website upgraded to >=8.20.1**: `webpack-bundle-analyzer` pinned ws to `^7`, resolving to 7.5.10 which is affected by an uninitialized memory disclosure (dependabot alert #14). An npm `overrides` entry in `website/package.json` forces ws to `>=8.20.1`.

## [1.36.2] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- **`detected_fields` underscore-proxy: `service.name` and `service_name` missing when OTel streams fall outside the 500-line scan window**: When running with `-label-style=underscores`, a wildcard `detected_fields` request samples the 500 most-recent log lines to infer field names. If all recent lines come from non-OTel streams (e.g. a continuous log generator), `service.name` and `service_name` never appear in the response even though OTel data exists in the time range. The fix checks the parallel-fetched native `field_names` index (which covers the full time range) and promotes both labels when `service.name` is present in the index but absent from the scan results. The promotion is skipped when the query already selects on `service_name` or `service.name` (stream-label selectors must stay suppressed from `detected_fields`, e.g. `{service_name="api-gateway"}`).

## [1.36.1] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **`| drop field=value` stream label mutation**: The proxy's matcher-form drop post-processing previously only removed matched fields from structured metadata and parsed fields, leaving stream labels (from VL's `_stream` field) unchanged. Loki's `| drop field=value` removes the field from the complete label set, including stream labels, when the value matches. The fix extends `applyDropConditionsToStreamLabels` to check stream labels and regroup entries under the modified label set when a match is found. The corrected behaviour applies to both the batch (FJ) query path and the streaming path.
- **`| keep field=value` matcher syntax**: The proxy translated `| keep method="GET"` into `| fields _time, _msg, _stream, method="GET"`, passing the matcher expression as a literal field name to VL — invalid VL syntax that causes a 400 error. The fix parses matcher forms in `keep` specs and projects only the field name (e.g. `method`) into the VL `| fields` clause. The matcher-form conditional semantics (keep the field only when value matches) are a known limitation; the fix at minimum prevents invalid VL queries.
- **Multi-tenant partial failures now surface Loki-compatible warnings**: When some (but not all) tenant sub-requests fail, the proxy returns HTTP 200 with an `X-Multi-Tenant-Partial-Failures` header. Grafana's Loki datasource reads the `warnings` array from the response body rather than custom headers, so the incomplete-data indicator was invisible. The fix injects a `"warnings"` field into the JSON response body for any partial-failure merge, matching the format Loki uses for similar scenarios.
- **Hot+cold merge no longer buffers the full merged NDJSON before trimming**: The backward-direction path buffered the entire cold body for reversal (required) then buffered the full merged stream before applying the per-request limit. The fix replaces the final `io.ReadAll` + `trimNDJSONBodyToLimit` with `readNDJSONToLimit`, which stops reading from the merged stream as soon as the limit is reached — halving the maximum RSS spike on large limit values.
- **`| drop field=value` matcher semantics**: The proxy previously translated `| drop field="value"` to VL's unconditional `| delete field`, which incorrectly removed the field from all log entries regardless of value. The fix: the translator no longer emits `| delete` for matcher-form drops; instead the proxy post-processes each classified entry and removes the field only when the value matches the condition. Bare-field drops (`| drop field`) continue to use `| delete` in VL unchanged. Supports `=`, `!=`, `=~`, and `!~` operators. Applies to both the batch query path (categorized-labels / Grafana Drilldown) and the streaming path.
- **`detected_fields` regression: `service.name` ghost field in Drilldown Fields tab**: When the proxy runs with `-emit-structured-metadata=true`, VictoriaLogs stores both `service_name` (stream label, shown in Labels tab) and `service.name` (OTel alias injected by the proxy). The `service.name` alias was incorrectly appearing in the Drilldown Fields tab as a string field with a single value (the service name). Fix: dotted/dashed fields whose sanitized (underscore) form IS already a stream label are now suppressed from `detected_fields` — they are emit-structured-metadata aliases, not independent fields. Genuine OTel data (where `service.name` is itself a stream label key) is unaffected.
- **`detected_fields` type instability: field type flipping between int/float and string**: When VictoriaLogs auto-indexes JSON log fields, some hex identifier strings (e.g. trace IDs like `"138ee486703e"`) accidentally satisfy Go's scientific-notation float parser (e.g. `"1e234"` parses as `+Inf`). A single such value caused `unifyDetectedType` to lock the entire field as `float` forever, because the prior implementation gave `float` precedence over `string`. The correct type-widening hierarchy (string > float > int) was inverted: `string` must always win so that any non-numeric sample forces the field to `string`. This caused Drilldown Fields to show numeric-looking types (float/int) for string fields, then flip on the next cache-miss refresh. Three regression tests added to prevent recurrence.
- **Drilldown "Logs" tab counter displaying label value instead of count**: The subtitle of the Grafana Logs Drilldown "Logs" tab briefly showed a stream label value (e.g. `"api-gateway"`) then switched to `"api-gatewayundefined"` instead of the total log count. Root cause: `sum(count_over_time({...} | json | filter [range]))` instant queries (no `by()` clause) routed to the manual log-fetch path (`collectRangeMetricSamples`), which grouped results by stream+level and returned one series per distinct stream (118 series for api-gateway) instead of a single aggregated count. Fix: when the original LogQL carries a bare outer aggregation without a `by()` or `without()` grouping modifier, `byExplicit` is set to `true` so all stream series collapse into one empty-label result — matching Loki's behaviour. The same collapse is applied to the query_range manual path. Three regression tests added covering the helper function, instant queries, and the exact Drilldown query shape.

## [1.36.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added

- **OTel structured metadata 3-tuple push**: E2E log generator now pushes OTel-originated log entries as Loki 3-tuple `[timestamp, line, metadata]` format, storing dotted OTel field names (`http.target`, `cloud.region`, `k8s.pod.name`) as structured metadata — matching real OTel Collector → Loki push behavior.

### Changed

- **Default `label-style` changed to `underscores`**: The proxy now translates OTel dotted stream label names (e.g., `service.name`, `k8s.pod.name`) to underscore form (`service_name`, `k8s_pod_name`) in all label and query responses by default. This matches Loki's OTel label translation behavior and eliminates dotted label names from Grafana UI. Previous default was `native` (pass-through). Set `-label-style=native` to restore previous behavior.
- **Default `metadata-field-mode` changed to `translated`**: Dotted metadata field names (e.g., `http.target`, `cloud.region`) are now translated to underscore form (`http_target`, `cloud_region`) in structuredMetadata responses by default. This matches Loki's OTel metadata translation behavior. Previous default was `native`. Set `-metadata-field-mode=native` or `-metadata-field-mode=hybrid` to expose native dotted names.
- **buildinfo version bumped to 3.7.1**: Grafana Loki datasource uses buildinfo to determine whether structuredMetadata is supported (requires Loki ≥ 3.0). Bumping the reported version to 3.7.1 enables structured metadata display in Grafana for VictoriaLogs-backed datasources.

### Fixed

- **`structuredMetadata` vs `parsedFields` classification**: Proxy now correctly classifies which fields belong in the `structuredMetadata` section vs `parsedFields` using `_msg` JSON content comparison. Fields present in the raw log line JSON are classified as parsedFields; fields absent from the log line are classified as structuredMetadata. Previously, all extra fields were misclassified.

### Tests

- **Exhaustive LogQL parity expanded to 316 cases**: 14 previously KnownGap test cases now pass and are promoted to full QueryParity assertions, covering `sort_desc(topk(...))`, `count_values`, nested `sum(sum(...))`, `| label_format` with template expressions, `| line_format` with Go template functions, multi-label `without()`, `label_replace`, `vector()`, `| decolorize`, `| unpack`, and double-negation regex filters.

## [1.35.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **`-tenant-label` flag**: Label-based VL tenant routing. When set to a VL field name (e.g., `-tenant-label=org_id`), injects `{org_id="<X-Scope-OrgID>"}` into every VL query instead of setting `AccountID`/`ProjectID` headers. Use when all log data lives under VL's default tenant (0:0) and is segregated by a label field. Explicit `-tenant-map` entries continue to use VL native tenancy and take priority. Default-tenant aliases (`0`, `fake`, `default`, `*`) bypass the filter. `TENANT_LABEL` environment variable also accepted.
- **`-forward-tenant-header` flag** (default `true`): Forward the per-tenant `X-Scope-OrgID` header to the upstream backend on each sub-request. Safe for VictoriaLogs (silently ignored). Required for Victoria Lakehouse native tenant routing. Set `-forward-tenant-header=false` or `FORWARD_TENANT_HEADER=false` to disable.
- **`-tenant-map-file` flag**: Load the OrgID→AccountID/ProjectID tenant mapping from a YAML or JSON file. Supports hot-reload via SIGHUP and automatic mtime-polling (default 30s) for Kubernetes ConfigMap volume updates without proxy restart. `TENANT_MAP_FILE` environment variable also accepted. File entries take priority over `-tenant-map` inline JSON for the same key.
- **`-tenant-map-reload-interval` flag** (default `30s`): Poll interval for detecting `-tenant-map-file` changes. Set to `0` to disable polling and rely on SIGHUP-only reload.
- **202-case exhaustive LogQL parity test machine**: `TestLogQL_Exhaustive_QueryParity`, `TestLogQL_Exhaustive_ErrorParity`, and `TestLogQL_Exhaustive_KnownGaps` verify result shape (resultType + series count) against Loki across 16 categories including stream selectors, line filters, parsers, metric queries, binary ops, subqueries, offset modifier, unwrap unit conversion, field-specific parsers, named regexp groups, vector matching, complex pipelines, and edge cases.
- **Configuration examples**: New `examples/` folder with runnable env files, tenant map YAML, Docker Compose stack, Grafana datasource provisioning, systemd unit, and Kubernetes ConfigMap with full annotated flag/env reference.

### Fixed

- **`sort()` / `sort_desc()` returned 0 results in query_range**: `applyMatrixPostAggregation` used `k` as the trim limit; for sort/sort_desc `k=0` (no argument), silently returning empty. Only topk/bottomk now trim to k.
- **`sort()` direction was wrong**: Was sorted descending (same as `sort_desc`). Fixed: `sort` ascending, `sort_desc` descending, matching Loki semantics.
- **`count()` outer aggregation generated invalid VL syntax**: Emitted `| stats count(__lvp_inner)` but VL `count()` takes no field argument. Fixed to emit `| stats count()`.
- **Recursive nested metric aggregation**: `count(sum by(app)(count_over_time(…)))` had no funcPattern match for the inner expression. `tryTranslateMetricQuery` now falls back to recursive translation when outerAgg is present and innerExpr contains a range selector.
- **Tail endpoint leaked across tenants with `-tenant-label`**: `openNativeTailStream` was bypassing `vlGetInner` injection path and not injecting the tenant-label filter. Now correctly injects the label filter for all query paths including tail.

### Security

- **LogsQL injection prevention**: `injectTenantLabelFilter` escapes backslash before double-quote to prevent LogsQL injection via crafted `X-Scope-OrgID` values; control characters in orgID values are rejected with HTTP 400.

### Breaking Changes

- **`X-Scope-OrgID` is now forwarded upstream by default**: The new `-forward-tenant-header` flag defaults to `true`, which means the proxy sends the client's `X-Scope-OrgID` header to the upstream backend on every sub-request — including deployments that use `-tenant-map` with numeric `AccountID`/`ProjectID` routing. VictoriaLogs silently ignores this header, so VL-backed deployments are unaffected. Deployments that proxy to a **Loki** or other backend that interprets `X-Scope-OrgID` may observe changed routing behavior. To restore the previous behavior (no `X-Scope-OrgID` forwarding), set `-forward-tenant-header=false` or `FORWARD_TENANT_HEADER=false`.

- **Tenant map now rejects non-numeric `account_id`/`project_id` at load time**: Both `-tenant-map` JSON and `-tenant-map-file` YAML/JSON now validate that every `account_id` and `project_id` value is a non-negative integer in the uint32 range (0–4294967295). Mappings with empty, negative, non-numeric, or out-of-range values are rejected on startup or reload with a descriptive error. Previously these values were silently forwarded as-is to VictoriaLogs (which would have rejected the request at the HTTP layer). Action required only if you had non-numeric IDs in your tenant map — correct them to valid integer strings.

### CI

- fix(ci): remove accidentally committed `bench/loki-bench` and `proxy.test` binaries; add both to `.gitignore` — fixes OpenSSF Scorecard Binary-Artifacts regression
- fix(ci): OpenSSF Scorecard now evaluates the PR/push commit instead of the default branch HEAD so Binary-Artifacts and other checks reflect what will land

- **e2e: multi-tenant `volume_range` regression tests**: verify `index/volume_range` returns time-series data with `__tenant_id__` labels in multi-tenant Drilldown context; cover both tenant-filtered and unfiltered cases.
- **e2e: multi-tenant field/label cardinality accuracy**: verify `detected_fields` cardinality ≥ known distinct values (GET/POST/DELETE for `method`); verify `detected_labels` includes `cardinality` field with value ≥ 1.
- **e2e: `| drop __error__` instant-query regression (#370)**: `sum(count_over_time(... | drop __error__))` as instant query must return exactly one aggregated result, not one per stream.
- **e2e: `detected_fields` after multi-stage pipeline**: `| json | drop __error__` pipeline must not suppress parsed JSON field names in `detected_fields` response.
- **e2e-ui: multi-tenant Explore scenarios**: cross-datasource switching (multi-tenant → single-tenant), missing tenant shows empty result not error banner, filter-for-value click interaction in multi-tenant context.
- **e2e-ui: multi-tenant Drilldown cardinality and error boundary**: field cards show non-zero cardinality badges, label filter scopes results to selected tenant, missing tenant shows empty result not browser crash.

## [1.33.1] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **Underscore proxy: Drilldown log count column shows per-stream results instead of aggregated total**: `sum(count_over_time({...} | json | logfmt | drop __error__, __error_details__ [interval]))` instant queries were incorrectly routed to the manual log-fetch path, which groups by `(_stream, level)` identity and produces per-stream series rather than a single aggregated count. `handleStatsCompatInstant` was missing the same drop-error fast-path gate that `handleStatsCompatRange` had — when the original LogQL explicitly opts in via `| drop __error__`, VL native `stats_query` returns a single `{metric:{}}` result matching Loki behavior. Introduced in the commit that restored the `__error__` guard to `shouldUseManualRangeMetricCompat` without extending it to the instant path.

- **Underscore proxy: `volume_range` returns empty log counts for Loki-push services**: `resolveTargetLabelFields` was translating `service_name` → `service.name` for the VL `/select/logsql/hits` endpoint, but Loki-push data stores the label as `service_name` (a stream label). The endpoint queried `service.name` which existed only for OTel-instrumented services, returning empty results for Loki-push services. Now appends the underscore form as a fallback field for known OTel semantic conventions so the `/hits` query covers both storage patterns. `TranslateLabelsMap` also coalesces when multiple VL fields map to the same Loki key, preferring the non-empty value (`service.name=""` + `service_name="api"` → `service_name="api"`).

## [1.33.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **`-require-tenant-header` flag**: Enforce the `X-Scope-OrgID` header on every request without enabling full Loki auth mode. When set, requests that omit the header receive `HTTP 401 missing X-Scope-OrgID header`. By default the proxy accepts header-less requests and routes them to the default tenant.

  This flag is independent of `-auth.enabled`. The distinction: `-auth.enabled` validates the *value* of the header (full Loki token auth); `-require-tenant-header` only checks that the header is *present*. Use `-require-tenant-header` when your gateway always injects `X-Scope-OrgID` and you want the proxy to reject anything that slips through without it — without standing up a full Loki auth pipeline.

  No action required for existing deployments. The default is `false`, preserving the current behavior.

- **`-manual-range-metric-row-limit` flag** (default: `1000000`): Configurable cap on the number of log rows the proxy fetches when computing `rate`, `count_over_time`, `bytes_over_time`, or `bytes_rate` by scanning raw log lines (the "manual range-metric compatibility" path used when native VictoriaLogs statistics cannot be applied). The cap was previously hard-coded to 1,000,000.

  Lower values reduce peak proxy memory for very high-cardinality queries at the cost of potentially truncated series. Raise above the default only if you see result truncation and can tolerate higher memory usage. The default preserves existing behavior — no tuning needed unless you hit the limit.

### Documentation

- **Hot+cold merge memory behavior** (`docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`): Documented that queries spanning both the hot (VictoriaLogs) and cold (Victoria Lakehouse) backends materialize the full merged result set in proxy memory before writing to the client. For backward-direction queries the cold result must be buffered entirely before it can be reversed — this is a structural constraint of the merge algorithm, not a fixable bug. Very large time ranges covering both backends will see higher proxy memory usage than hot-only queries. Mitigation: bound cold query time ranges, or route cold-only queries directly to the cold backend.

## [1.32.4] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **Underscore proxy: Drilldown log count blank for Loki-push services**: When using `-label-style=underscores`, `sum by (service_name) (count_over_time(...))` queries returned `service_name=""` for services whose labels were stored as Loki stream labels (not VL dotted fields). The proxy translated `by(service_name)` → `by(service.name)`, but VL returned an empty value when no dotted field existed — Grafana Drilldown then displayed the label name as text instead of a numeric count. Fixed by expanding the `by()` clause to include both forms; VL groups by whichever exists and the response is coalesced to prefer the non-empty value.

## [1.32.3] - 2026-05-14

### CI

- fix(ci): `LOC Badges` workflow now pushes badge JSON to the unprotected `badges` branch instead of directly to `main`. Branch protection on `main` (requires PR + signed commits + status checks) was blocking the bot push and causing the workflow to fail on every merge. README badge URLs updated from `main` to `badges` branch.

## [1.32.2] - 2026-05-14

### Breaking Changes

- **Mixed-offset expressions now return HTTP 400**: A LogQL expression where some range vectors carry an `offset` and others do not — e.g. `rate({app="a"}[5m] offset 1h) + rate({app="b"}[5m])` — now returns `HTTP 400` with a descriptive error instead of silently returning incorrect data. The proxy implements offset support via a global time shift applied to `start`/`end`; that shift cannot correctly serve a mix of offset-bearing and non-offset range vectors in the same expression.

  **Who is affected**: Queries combining `offset`-bearing and non-`offset` range vectors in a single expression. Queries where all range vectors share the same offset (e.g. both use `offset 1h`) continue to work.

  **How to fix**: Split the expression into two separate queries — one with the offset applied, one without — and combine the results in Grafana. Alternatively, add the same offset to all range vectors if the intent allows it.

### Fixed

- **Mixed-offset correctness**: The proxy previously applied only the first offset value it encountered in a query, silently ignoring offsets on other range vectors. A query like `rate({app="a"}[5m] offset 1h) + rate({app="b"}[5m])` would return data for `b` from the wrong time window. These queries now return HTTP 400. See breaking change note above.

## [1.32.1] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **Local compose stack: `/loki/api/v1/patterns` always empty** (`test/e2e-compat`): The `log-generator` service was gated behind a Docker Compose `ui` profile, so running `docker compose up` without `--profile ui` started the full proxy stack with zero log ingestion. The proxy's pattern miner had nothing to cluster, leaving the patterns endpoint empty. The profile gate has been removed — `log-generator` now starts alongside the proxy by default.

  Log throughput was also raised from ~8.6 to ~75 lines/s (`LOG_INTERVAL` 10→2, `LOG_BATCH` 8→15) so the miner receives enough log lines per time bucket to produce stable clusters and a continuous timeline in Grafana Logs Drilldown. Memory limit `GOMEMLIMIT=2GiB` added to `loki-vl-proxy-patterns-autodetect` consistent with other proxy containers.

  Affects the local `test/e2e-compat` compose stack only. Automated CI tests run without the compose stack and are not affected.

## [1.32.0] - 2026-05-13

### Breaking Changes

> **Review this section before upgrading from any version that predates 1.32.0.**

- **`offset` is no longer silently dropped**: Before this release, LogQL queries containing an `offset` modifier (e.g. `rate({app="nginx"}[5m] offset 1h)`) were accepted without error, but the offset was silently ignored — the proxy returned data for the *current* evaluation window as if no offset were specified. Starting with 1.32.0, the offset is applied correctly: the evaluation window is shifted backward by the specified duration before the query is dispatched to VictoriaLogs.

  **Who is affected**: Any dashboard, alert, or recording rule that uses an `offset` modifier and was relying (intentionally or not) on the proxy returning current-time data. After upgrading, those queries will return data from the offset-shifted window, which is the correct Loki-compatible behavior.

  **How to check**: Search your dashboards and alert rules for queries containing `offset`. If they were authored knowing offset was broken and worked around the limitation by other means, review them before upgrading.

- **Multiple distinct offsets in the same query now return HTTP 400**: A query that applies different offset values to different range vectors — for example `rate({app="a"}[5m] offset 1h) + rate({app="b"}[5m] offset 2h)` — now returns `HTTP 400` with a descriptive error message. Previously, the proxy silently used only the first offset it found, producing incorrect results for the vector with the other offset.

  **Who is affected**: Queries combining range vectors with *different* offsets. Queries where all range vectors share the *same* offset (e.g. `rate(...)[5m] offset 1h) + rate(...)[5m] offset 1h)`) continue to work correctly.

  **How to fix**: Split the query into two separate queries, one per offset value, and combine the results in Grafana. Alternatively, rewrite to use the same offset across all range vectors if the intent allows it.

### Added

- **`offset` directive support**: The proxy now correctly handles the LogQL `offset` modifier on range vectors. The proxy strips the `offset` clause from the query sent to VictoriaLogs and instead shifts the request's `start`/`end` parameters (range queries) or `time` parameter (instant queries) backward by the offset duration, producing semantically correct results without requiring native VictoriaLogs offset support.

## [1.31.4] - 2026-05-13

### Documentation

- docs: comprehensive accuracy audit across 9 doc files — fix wrong flag defaults (`-cb-open-duration` 2s→10s, `goMemLimitPercent` 70→85, `GOGC` 100→200, Go requirement 1.26.2→1.26.3, Loki benchmark stack 3.4.x→3.6.x), correct "not exposed as flags" claim for `-rate-limit-per-second`/`-rate-limit-burst`/`-max-concurrent` in configuration.md + operations.md + scaling.md, add missing Cold Storage Backend section to configuration.md (`-cold-enabled`, `-cold-backend`, `-cold-boundary`, `-cold-overlap`, `-cold-manifest-refresh`, `-cold-timeout`; shipped in 1.28.0 with zero doc coverage), add Go Runtime Tuning flag section, extend compatibility-loki.md release notes from v1.17.1 through v1.31.2, clarify buildinfo `2.9.0` is intentional.

## [1.31.3] - 2026-05-13

### CI

- fix(ci): `auto-release` now exits cleanly with `should_release=false` when `## [Unreleased]` is empty — deps-bump and CI-only PRs previously reached `validate-release` and failed noisily; fixed `DOCS_OR_CI_ONLY` regex (trailing `$` prevented `docs/subpath` and `.github/subpath` from matching).

### Performance

- perf(range_metric): remove parser-stage guard from `shouldUseManualRangeMetricCompat` — `rate`, `bytes_rate`, `count_over_time`, and `bytes_over_time` queries containing `| json` or `| logfmt` parser stages now use VL native `stats_query_range` for tumbling windows (`range == step`), previously forced onto the raw log-fetch slow path regardless of window configuration.
- perf(range_metric): add `stats_query_range` fast path for `sum by (...) (count_over_time/rate({...}[W]))` — replaces raw NDJSON log scan (39% CPU cold proxy) with VL pre-aggregated Prometheus buckets via `| stats by (...) count() as c`. Throughput improvement: 44→126 req/s (c=10) and 33→139 req/s (c=100) on heavy workload.
- perf(range_metric): extend fast path to `bytes_over_time`/`bytes_rate` using `| stats by (...) sum_len(_msg) as c` — eliminates 4664ms P50 bottleneck for byte-rate metric queries at cold concurrency.
- perf(patterns): pool `strings.Builder` in `patternLineTokenizer.Join` via `patternJoinBuilderPool` — eliminates per-log-entry heap allocation that was 6237 MB flat (15.56%) and driving `bytes.growSlice` cascade at cold concurrency.
- perf(drilldown): rewrite `parseLogfmtFields` to single-pass byte scanning — eliminates intermediate `tokens` slice, `strings.Builder` per token, and `strings.SplitN` allocation (was `strings.genSplit` 302 MB flat, 4.79% at cold concurrency); uses `strings.IndexByte` on in-place slices instead.
- perf(drilldown): eliminate duplicate `parseStreamLabels` calls in `detectFieldSummariesStream` — was called 3× per log entry (inside `fillDetectedLabelsFJ`, `isOTelDataFJ`, and directly); refactored to parse `_stream` once and pass pre-parsed map via `fillDetectedLabelsFJWithStream` and `isOTelLabels`; also deferred `key := string(keyBytes)` allocation in `obj.Visit` callbacks until after cheap early-return guards.
- perf(series): replace `encoding/json` with fastjson + direct `strings.Builder` write in `handleSeries` — `encoding/json.Unmarshal` + `json.Marshal(map[string]string)` was 17.88% cum in cold-proxy alloc profile; now uses pooled fastjson parser for input and `jsonBuilderPool` + `appendJSONStringToBuilder` for output; removes `encoding/json` import from `label_handlers.go` entirely.
- perf(streams): eliminate per-entry `string([]byte)` allocations in `vlReaderToLokiStreams` and `vlLogsToLokiWindowEntriesStream` — new `logQueryStreamDescriptorBytes` builds cache key in a 512-byte stack buffer and uses Go's `m[string([]byte)]` zero-alloc compiler optimisation for cache hits (was 21.93% cum); miss path still allocates once per unique stream+level pair. Pre-grow `strings.Builder` in `reconstructLogLineWithFlagFJ` to `len(msg)+64` bytes — prevents `bytes.growSlice` from firing on typical log entries (was 1.18 GB flat / 19.17% alloc_space).
- perf(stats): pool scratch `[]byte` for fastjson `MarshalTo` calls via `fjMarshalPool` — eliminates per-call allocation in `trimStatsQRByTimeFJ` and `writeFilteredStatsQRSeriesFJ` (was ~5 GB flat in compute alloc profile). Replace `encoding/json` with fastjson + direct byte assembly in the stats response hot path (`translateStatsResponseLabelsWithContext`).
- perf(stats): `translateStatsResponseLabelsWithContext` now writes `{"status":"success",...}` prefix — `wrapAsLokiResponse` fast path A returns the buffer zero-alloc instead of `append([]byte{...}, body[1:]...)` which allocated ~3.5 GB per compute run.
- perf(stats): pre-compute `canonicalLabelsKey` once per unique stream in the descriptor miss path and store in `queryRangeWindowEntry.Key` — eliminates repeated `canonicalLabelsKey` calls in `groupQueryRangeWindowEntries` (~2.5 GB cum eliminated in heavy workload).
- perf(stats): replace `json.Marshal(map[string]interface{}{...})` in `proxyLogQueryWindowed` with `marshalWindowedStreamsResult` — direct byte building eliminates reflection overhead (~3.5 GB cum).
- perf(stats): store translated label maps as `[]map[string]string` instead of pre-serialized `[][][]byte` in `translateStatsResponseLabelsWithContext` — defers JSON serialization to write pass via zero-alloc `marshalStringMapJSONTo`, eliminating ~7.3 GB of `appendJSONString` allocations in compute workload. Combined alloc fix impact: compute cold 40 → 210 req/s (+5.25×), heavy cold 102 → 115 req/s (+13%).

## [1.31.2] - 2026-05-12

### Performance

- perf(proxy): pool `gzip.Reader` instances in `decodeCompressedHTTPResponse` via `sync.Pool`, eliminating a per-response allocation on the VL fetch path.
- perf(windowing): pool `bytes.Buffer` used for gob-encoding window cache entries in `fetchQueryRangeWindow`, removing one allocation per cached window write with 8+ parallel windows per Drilldown request.
- perf(range_metric): rewrite `aggregateManualWindow` to use inline scalar accumulators for count, rate, sum, avg, min, max, bytes_over_time, bytes_rate, first, and last — eliminating the `[]float64` slice allocation (896 B/op → 0 B/op) for the common path; quantile, stddev, stdvar, and rate_counter retain the full slice.

## [1.31.1] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- fix(range_metric): replace broad `strings.Contains(query, "__error__")` guard with precise `hasDropErrorOnlyPostParserStage` check in the tumbling-window fast path. Only queries that structurally contain `| drop __error__[, __error_details__]` as the sole post-parser stage are routed to VL native stats (count-all semantics). This prevents false positives from queries where `__error__` appears in label values or other positions unrelated to parse-error opt-in.

## [1.31.0] - 2026-05-11

### Performance

- perf(range_metric): replace `encoding/json` unmarshal with `fastjson` in `collectRangeMetricSamples`, eliminating per-entry heap allocations for map[string]interface{} decoding and reducing GC pressure on high-cardinality metric queries.

### Fixed

- fix(range_metric): remove `+3` pre-allocation hint from `make(map[string]string, ...)` in `buildMetricSeriesEntry` to eliminate integer overflow risk (CodeQL CWE-190). Map growth is amortised and the hint provided no measurable benefit.
- fix(range_metric): `fetchBareParserMetricSeries` no longer adds parsed JSON fields (e.g. `path`, `method`, `status`) to metric series labels. Bare `rate(| json)` and similar queries now group by stream labels only, matching Loki's behaviour where parsed fields only become metric dimensions when explicitly named in an outer `by (...)` aggregation.
- ci: increase all fuzz smoke test timeouts from 10 s to 12 s to eliminate spurious "context deadline exceeded" failures caused by Go's fuzz framework firing its internal deadline marginally after the nominal budget.

## [1.30.0] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- fix(detected_fields): `service_name` alias now correctly appears in detected_fields for hybrid datasets (OTel `service.name` entries mixed with pre-normalised `service_name` stream-label entries). The previous guard blocked the alias whenever any entry in the query window carried a literal `service_name` stream label; the guard now checks for the presence of a dotted `service.name` stream key instead, so OTel aliases remain visible in hybrid streams.
- fix(tail): pass `offset=0` to VL's `/select/logsql/tail` endpoint, overriding VL's default 5-second tail window offset that was causing a timing collision with the 5 s `ResponseHeaderTimeout` on the tail client. Without the override, data pushed at T+0 is only visible to VL's tail at T+5 s, causing spurious connection timeouts.

## [1.29.8] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed

- fix(proxy): bare parser metrics (`rate`, `count_over_time`, `bytes_over_time`, `bytes_rate` with `| json` / `| logfmt`) no longer take the native `stats_query_range` fast path unless the query explicitly handles `__error__` (e.g. `| drop __error__, __error_details__`). Per Loki's error model, log lines that fail parsing are excluded from metric aggregation; VL native stats counts all lines, producing overcounts on mixed valid/invalid inputs. Queries without `__error__` handling now route to the correct slow log-fetch path.
- fix(cold): backward cold log queries now return the N newest rows across the full queried time range. The previous implementation sent a single `maxLimitValue`-capped request to Victoria Lakehouse, which (scanning ascending and applying its limit before streaming) returned rows from only the oldest 10 000 matches. Replaced with `coldBackwardChunkedFetch`: a 1-hour slice iterator that scans newest-to-oldest and stops as soon as the client limit is satisfied, covering both `RouteColdOnly` (`proxyLogQueryCold`) and `RouteBoth` (`proxyLogQueryBoth`) paths.

## [1.29.7] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- feat(e2e): add `grafana-lokiexplore-app` (Logs Drilldown) plugin to e2e-compat Grafana stack, enabling end-to-end drilldown test coverage

### Fixed

- fix(e2e): change tail-ingress healthcheck from `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` — Alpine musl libc resolves `localhost` to `::1` (IPv6) while nginx listens only on IPv4, causing the container to always appear unhealthy
- chore: bump Go toolchain from 1.26.2 to 1.26.3 to resolve govulncheck vulnerabilities GO-2026-4971 and GO-2026-4918 in the standard library

## [1.29.6] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed

- fix(drilldown): `detected_level=""` log level filter now correctly matches log entries with no detected level — the translator was emitting `level:=""` (explicit empty string only) instead of `-level:*` (absent or empty), so entries where the `level` field was simply absent were never returned; applies to both stream-selector and pipeline-filter positions
- fix(volume): `computeVolumeRangeResult` no longer appends `| sort by (_time desc)` to VL hits queries — the `/select/logsql/hits` endpoint counts log hits per time bucket and ignores sort stages, so the trailing sort was a no-op that added query overhead
- fix(drilldown): `volumeByDerivedLabels` volume histogram now correctly renders for `detected_level` target — `parseVolumeBoundary` was treating all numeric timestamps as nanoseconds (`time.Unix(0, n)`), so Unix-second inputs produced a 1970 epoch boundary that filtered out all 2026 log entries; changed to use `parseFlexibleUnixSeconds` which correctly normalises both second and nanosecond inputs

## [1.29.5] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- fix(cold): `RouteBoth` backward queries now correctly reverse the cold half before merging — previously cold rows from `[start, boundary]` were appended oldest-first after the newest-first hot half; cold also now sends `maxLimitValue` to the Lakehouse so the N newest cold rows are available after reversal and the final trim to the client limit returns the correct rows
- fix(drilldown): `detected_fields` no longer returns thousands of fields ("Fields 5,965") for queries with parser stages — VL auto-indexes all JSON keys from `_msg` into a time-range-wide native field index; the proxy now uses only the 500-line log scan result when it is non-empty, discarding the native index which accumulates thousands of field names from rare log variants across the full time range
- fix(drilldown): `detected_fields` no longer double-counts fields from JSON `_msg` — VL also returns auto-indexed JSON keys as top-level NDJSON fields; a new pre-pass collects `_msg` JSON keys and skips them in the outer native field visit so they are only added once via `_msg` parsing with the correct `parser="json"` tag
- fix(metrics): metric queries no longer include `_stream="{app=\"...\",...}"` as a raw label — `addGroupByParsedLabels` now skips VL internal fields (`_stream`, `_msg`, `_time`) that appear in `groupBy` to prevent the raw JSON stream string leaking into the metric label set

## [1.29.4] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- fix(cold): `RouteColdOnly` backward queries with an explicit `limit` now return the N *newest* rows instead of the N *oldest* — the Lakehouse scans ascending and applies its limit before returning, so the proxy fetches up to `maxLimitValue` rows, reverses, then trims to the original limit
- fix(drilldown): `detected_fields` now returns fields for queries with a parser followed by field-comparison filters (e.g. `| logfmt | error_code!=""`) — the primary scan was stripping `| logfmt` but keeping the filter, so VL could not evaluate `error_code:!""` without `unpack_logfmt` and returned zero rows; the parser stage is now preserved when downstream filters depend on it
- fix(metrics): bare parser metric tumbling-window queries (`step == range`) now use the native VL stats path and group by stream labels only, matching Loki's behaviour — the manual aggregation path was leaking parsed fields (e.g. `duration_ms`) into metric labels for these queries

## [1.29.3] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- fix(drilldown): strip generic parser stages (`| json`, `| logfmt`, `| unpack`, `| drop __error__`) from the primary field-detection scan query — keeping them caused VL to parse all embedded fields from 500 diverse log lines, producing 35 000+ garbage field entries (log tokens treated as field names) in Grafana Drilldown
- fix(drilldown): `handleDetectedFields` now falls back to a native-only VL `field_names` index lookup on the bare stream selector when the strict query returns zero fields — keeps the Drilldown fields panel populated when a specific field-value filter narrows the log sample below the scan threshold, without performing a broad log-line scan that would return unrelated fields
- fix(cold): cold-only (`RouteColdOnly`) queries with `direction=backward` now reverse the NDJSON body before processing — the Lakehouse always returns rows ascending and does not support a sort clause, so the proxy reverses the response to match Loki's default newest-first ordering
- fix(metrics): `without()` aggregation on sliding-window range metrics now correctly routes through the manual aggregation path and expands `_stream` to all stream label keys — previously the `without()` exception bypassed the manual path, causing fallback to native VL stats that does not support sliding windows

## [1.29.2] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- fix(cold): `RouteBoth` hot-backend failure now propagates a `502` error instead of silently returning cold-only partial data — cold covers `[start, boundary]` only, so serving it alone truncates the live `[boundary, end]` range without the client knowing
- fix(cold): apply the original per-request `limit` to the merged hot+cold NDJSON body — without this up to 2× the requested limit could be returned (one batch per backend)
- fix(metric): disable native VL stats fast path for `rate`/`count_over_time`/`bytes_over_time`/`bytes_rate` when extracting parser stages (`| unpack_json`, `| extract`, etc.) are present without explicit `__error__` handling — VL native stats may not replicate Loki's `__error__` exclusion semantics for parse-failure lines

## [1.29.1] - 2026-05-05

### Performance

- perf: switch L1 cache read path from write lock to `sync.RWMutex.RLock()` with deferred LRU promotion via buffered channel — eliminates per-read mutex contention under concurrent queries (~+80–100 req/s, −5ms P50)
- perf: short-circuit `RateLimiter.Middleware` when both `maxConcurrent` and `ratePerSecond` are disabled — returns the handler directly with zero allocations (~+10 req/s)
- perf: skip `sort.SliceStable` tie-breaking pass on log streams that contain no duplicate nanosecond timestamps — avoids O(n log n) work per stream in the common case (~+10 req/s)
- perf: skip inner `p.cache` lookup when `compatCacheMiddleware` is active — avoids a redundant LRU read and response-capture allocation on the compat cache hit path (~+20 req/s, −2ms P50)
- perf: sample per-request access logs for successful 2xx responses via `-log-request-sample-rate N` — skips log-attribute assembly for N−1 of every N requests; errors always logged (~+25–30 req/s at high throughput)

## [1.29.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- feat(metrics): expose `process_cpu_seconds_total` counter via `/metrics` — cumulative user+system CPU seconds using `syscall.Getrusage`; also emitted as `loki_vl_proxy_process_cpu_seconds_total` for namespaced scrape configs

## [1.28.7] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- fix(metric): route sliding-window `rate()`, `bytes_rate()`, `count_over_time`, and `bytes_over_time` (range≠step) to manual log-fetch aggregation instead of native VictoriaLogs `stats_query_range`; VL uses tumbling per-step buckets that diverge from LogQL sliding-window semantics when data distribution is non-uniform

## [1.28.6] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- fix(cold): remove LogsQL `| sort by (_time)` clause from Victoria Lakehouse cold queries — the Lakehouse filter parser treats bare tokens as `_msg` substring filters, so the clause was silently corrupting results instead of sorting them
- fix(cold): propagate cold backend errors instead of falling back to hot — `RouteColdOnly` queries cover ranges where hot has no data; a silent hot fallback returned empty 200 responses masking cold failures; `RouteBoth` cold failures now propagate rather than silently truncating the time range

### Changed

- refactor(cold): `RouteBoth` now time-splits requests at the hot/cold boundary — cold receives `[start, boundary]` and hot receives `[boundary, end]`, eliminating boundary overlap and duplicate rows; merge order is direction-aware (hot-first for backward queries, cold-first for forward queries)

## [1.28.5] - 2026-05-04

### Performance

- perf: replace `json.Marshal` with `appendJSONStringToBuilder` in `reconstructLogLine` variants — eliminates per-field `[]byte` allocation; merges duplicate function bodies and adopts `startLen` trick to remove redundant map scan pass
- perf: replace `stdjson` fallback in `extractLogPatternsWithStats` with fastjson via `vlFJParserPool` — eliminates `interface{}` tree allocation on the wrapped-JSON fallback path; uses `stringifyFJValue` for pair elements
- perf: replace `stdjson.Marshal` map literals in `wrapAsLokiResponse` with direct byte builders — eliminates reflection allocations from fixed-shape error/envelope responses
- refactor: move `canonicalLabelsKey` from `drilldown.go` to `labels.go` where other label utilities live

## [1.28.2] - 2026-05-04

### Changed

- refactor: remove unused `fillDetectedLabels` function — dead code after `scanDetectedLabelSummariesStream` migrated to `fillDetectedLabelsFJ` in the fastjson migration (#311)

## [1.28.1] - 2026-05-03

### Performance

- perf: migrate `scanDetectedLabelSummariesStream` in drilldown from `encoding/json` + `map[string]interface{}` to `valyala/fastjson`, eliminating per-entry heap allocation on the detected-labels NDJSON scan path

## [1.28.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- feat(proxy): add cold storage routing — time-range-based query splitting between hot (EBS VictoriaLogs) and cold (S3 Victoria Lakehouse) backends with configurable boundary, parallel fan-out, NDJSON merge, manifest-aware routing, and graceful degradation on backend failures.

## [1.27.3] - 2026-05-03

### Performance

- perf: eliminate degenerate 1-ns tail window for queries whose duration is an exact multiple of the split interval (e.g. 1h query + 1h split); the loop now extends the last window by 1 ns instead of issuing a redundant second VL round-trip
- perf: skip `reconstructLogLineWithFlagFJ` for `| json` queries; Loki returns the original log line unchanged for `| json`, so wrapping it in a new JSON envelope was both a parity divergence and unnecessary per-entry CPU cost
- perf: offload `maybeAutodetectPatternsFromWindowEntries` to a background goroutine, removing ~21% proxy CPU from the client-visible request path (both this function and `groupQueryRangeWindowEntries` are read-only over the entries slice; concurrent execution is safe)
- perf: rewrite `isIPLike` with a single-pass byte scan, eliminating the `strings.Split` allocation on every call (was 4.88% cumulative CPU in pprof)
- perf: replace `strings.Trim` in `patternPlaceholderForToken` with a `[256]bool` lookup table, eliminating per-call `strings.makeASCIISet` allocation (was 2.77% flat CPU)
- perf: cap background pattern autodetect at 500 stride-sampled entries; `full_volume_1h` queries return up to 5000 entries but pattern clustering converges at ~500, cutting miner CPU 10× for high-volume windows
- perf: port patterns endpoint NDJSON parser from `encoding/json` + `map[string]interface{}` to `valyala/fastjson`, eliminating per-entry map allocation on the patterns hot path

## [1.27.2] - 2026-05-03

### Performance

- perf: replace `json.Marshal`/`json.Unmarshal` on the window cache hot path with `encoding/gob` and concrete typed fields; eliminates `interface{}` reflection allocations from cache read/write, reducing CPU ~40% on cache-hit-heavy workloads

## [1.27.1] - 2026-05-02

### Performance

- perf: raise HTTP transport `ReadBufferSize`/`WriteBufferSize` from 4 KB (Go default) to 64 KB, reducing syscall count ~7× for typical 27 KB VL responses; set `DisableCompression=true` so proxy fully owns `Accept-Encoding` negotiation (no silent gzip override by net/http)

## [1.27.0] - 2026-05-02

### Performance

- perf: replace stdlib `compress/gzip` with `klauspost/gzip` (2.5–3× faster decode, 2× faster encode) across all proxy–VL and proxy–client paths
- perf: auto-detect loopback VL backend (`localhost`/`127.x`/`::1`) and request uncompressed responses (`Accept-Encoding: identity`), eliminating 25–35% decompression CPU for co-located deployments; remote backends continue to use gzip
- perf: migrate `detectFieldSummariesStream` from `encoding/json` to `fastjson`, skip JSON re-parse for non-JSON `_msg` content, pool 64 KB scanner buffers — reduces CPU by ~15–20% on detected_fields hot path
- perf: compress window cache entries with zstd (5–15× size reduction), eliminate per-entry metadata classification for standard Grafana requests
- perf: custom stream response serialiser replaces `encoding/json` reflection with direct buffer writes; eliminate `json.Marshal` allocations in log-line reconstruction; adaptive per-stream skip for streams with no extra fields

## [1.26.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added

- feat(security): enable NetworkPolicy by default (`networkPolicy.enabled: true`) with restrictive ingress (Grafana→3100) and egress (VictoriaLogs→9428 + DNS) rules; set `networkPolicy.enabled=false` only when a cluster-wide policy already covers this workload.
- feat(security): add `.github/dependabot.yml` to auto-update GitHub Actions, Go modules, and the Docker builder base image weekly — keeps supply-chain dependencies current without manual SHA management.

### Fixed

- fix(proxy): move `withOrgID` / `injectAuthFingerprint` before `preferWorkingParser` in `handleQueryRange` and `handleQuery` so all upstream VictoriaLogs calls (parser-probe, bare-parser fast-path, post-aggregation) carry the correct tenant context and forwarded auth headers.
- fix(proxy): expand first-bucket shift detection in `statsRateRangeEqualsStepShift` to cover `bytes_rate()` and outer-aggregated `rate()`/`bytes_rate()` (e.g. `sum by (level) (rate({...} | json [1m]))`); previously only a bare top-level `rate()` was detected — now uses substring scan of the full expression to find the metric function regardless of nesting depth.
- fix(proxy): disable the bare-parser metric fast path (`proxyBareParserMetricViaStats`) when the translated VL query contains `unpack_json` or `unpack_logfmt` stages; VL's unpack pipes do not model Loki's `__error__` filtering (Loki excludes non-parseable lines, VL may include them), so the fast path is only safe for queries that translate without parser stages.
- fix(proxy): align `reconstructLogLineWithFlag` with `reconstructLogLine` — remove the spurious `level` exclusion from the emit loop and add blank-value trimming, preventing `level` from being silently dropped from reconstructed JSON log lines in the query-range windowing path.
- fix(proxy): guard synthetic `service_name` derivation behind `hadStream` so that aggregated `sum by (label)` metrics (e.g. for Drilldown volume include/exclude) contain only the grouping label and never gain an unexpected extra key.
- fix(proxy): Drilldown volume `targetLabels` filter now applies to all stream labels universally, not only `container`; the `buildVolumeMetric` helper strips any label key absent from the `targetLabels` set regardless of which field was requested.
- fix(proxy): reject negative window durations in `parseOriginalRangeMetricSpec` — `parseLokiDuration` can return `math.MinInt64` for crafted inputs; guard with `if spec.Window < 0 { return …, false }` prevents downstream shift calculations from overflowing.
- fix(security): emit `slog.Warn` when OTLP `TLSSkipVerify=true` is active so operators can see the insecure configuration in logs; the flag default remains `false`.
- fix(helm): complete container-level seccomp hardening — add `seccompProfile: type: RuntimeDefault`, `runAsGroup: 65534` to `containerSecurityContext` in `values.yaml` (pod-level profile was present; container-level is now explicit for stricter admission controllers); align test-connection pod containers with the same full security context (`runAsNonRoot`, `runAsUser`, `runAsGroup`, `seccompProfile`) and add `runAsGroup`/`fsGroup` to the test pod spec.
- fix(e2e): remove hardcoded `_msg` fields from all JSON-format log generators (`gen_api_gateway`, `gen_auth_service`, `gen_frontend_ssr`, `gen_batch_etl`, `gen_ml_serving`) so that `_inject_vl_msg` can set `_msg` to the full JSON line, ensuring consistent Grafana rendering between Loki and VictoriaLogs.
- fix(e2e): anchor `sharedWindow` start in explore-contract tests to `ingestionAnchor` (set at the moment `ingestRichTestData` runs) rather than `time.Now()`, preventing the window from drifting past ingested data in slow CI environments.
- perf(proxy): pass outer request `ctx` (which holds the memoized `authFingerprintKey` set by `injectAuthFingerprint`) instead of `origReq.Context()` in metadata coalescer key helpers (`nativeCoalescerKey`, `vlGetMetadataCoalesced`, `fetchStreamFieldNamesCached`, `fetchPreferredLabelNamesCached`, `detectedFieldsCacheKey`, `detectedLabelsCacheKey`), so the OPT5 fingerprint memoization is actually used rather than recomputed on each call.

## [1.25.1] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- perf(proxy): add `--unique-windows` benchmark flag so each worker gets a distinct non-overlapping time window, bypassing the singleflight coalescer and response cache to expose raw proxy translation overhead.
- perf(gc): add `-go-gc-percent` flag (default 200) to reduce GC frequency at the cost of higher peak RSS; overridden by `GOGC` env var. GOGC configuration consolidated into `memlimit` package alongside GOMEMLIMIT.

### Changed

- perf(binary): parallelize VL operand fetches in `proxyBinaryMetric`, `proxyBinaryMetricVM`, and `executeSubqueryStepQuery` — binary expressions now issue both HTTP requests concurrently, halving latency for binary metric queries.
- perf(stats): route `avg_over_time`, `sum_over_time`, `min_over_time`, `max_over_time`, `quantile_over_time`, `stddev_over_time`, `stdvar_over_time`, `first_over_time`, and `last_over_time` with parser stages to VL's native `stats_query_range` instead of the manual NDJSON path.
- perf(stats): use `json.RawMessage` for time-series `value`/`values` fields in stats response structs — raw bytes are copied verbatim through marshal/unmarshal, eliminating interface{} allocation and reflect encoding for time-series data.
- perf(stats): preserve `resultType` through `trimStatsQueryRangeResponseToEnd` so `wrapAsLokiResponse` fast-path (byte-splice) triggers correctly instead of falling back to full `json.Unmarshal` + `json.Marshal` on every response.
- perf(stats): skip re-marshal in `translateStatsResponseLabelsWithContext` when no label translation occurred, returning the original body unchanged.
- perf(proxy): skip `RedactSecrets` regexp patterns for strings that contain no secret-looking keywords, using a fast `strings.Contains` pre-check.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- fix(e2e): add `_msg` field to all JSON-format log generators so VictoriaLogs stores the human-readable message correctly and Grafana renders JSON service logs consistently with Loki.
- fix(proxy): reconstruct JSON log lines so `|= "text"` line filters match any JSON field, not only the extracted `_msg` value; VL entries with extra fields are re-serialised as `{"_msg":"...","field":"value"}` before returning to Grafana.
- fix(translator): revert line filter translation from invalid `*:~"text"` VictoriaLogs syntax to `~"text"` (regex/substring on `_msg`), which is valid across all supported VL versions.
- fix(proxy): explicit logfmt/JSON `level=warn` field now always wins over VictoriaLogs auto-detected `detected_level`; previously VL could surface `detected_level=info` from `_msg` while also providing `level=warn`, causing Grafana to display the wrong log level badge.
- fix(loki): raise `max_query_series` from 500 to 5000 to match Loki defaults and prevent truncated series results on high-cardinality label queries.

### Changed

- perf: replace `sync.Pool`-based gzip writer pool with a buffered-channel pool (`gzipWriterChan`) that survives GC cycles, eliminating pool churn under sustained load and reducing per-request allocation overhead on the response compression path.
- perf: amortise `metadataFieldExposures` lookup across all NDJSON entries in a batch via a per-batch `exposureCache` map, and pool the `smBuf`/`pfBuf` structured-metadata and parsed-field accumulator maps with `metadataMapPool` to cut per-entry heap allocations by ~5 GB/30 s under load.
- perf: use a typed `vlStreamEntry` struct for NDJSON `_stream` field unmarshalling (replaces `map[string]interface{}`), and eliminate double string/byte conversions in the drilldown NDJSON hot path; pool the per-entry label buffer in `scanDetectedLabelSummaries` and `detectFieldSummaries` to reduce detected-labels allocations by ~1.8 GB/30 s.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- refactor: split `internal/proxy/proxy.go` (14,105 lines) into 19 domain-focused modules (`middleware.go`, `stream_processing.go`, `multitenant.go`, `patterns.go`, `patterns_persistence.go`, `cache_keys.go`, `label_metadata.go`, `label_handlers.go`, `http_utils.go`, `query_translation.go`, `metric_agg.go`, `metric_binary.go`, `alerting.go`, `tail.go`, `volume.go`, `backend.go`, `label_index.go`, `telemetry.go`, `time_utils.go`), reducing `proxy.go` to 1,577 lines; no functional changes.
- ci: extend `fuzz-smoke` job with all 23 previously missing fuzz targets across `internal/proxy`, `internal/translator`, `internal/cache`, and `internal/rulesmigrate`.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- security: all cache keys (label_inventory, queryRange, detected_fields/labels, native_fields/streams coalescer, patterns autodetect, volume/range) now include an auth fingerprint (SHA-256 of configured forward headers + cookies), preventing tenants from receiving each other's cached metadata responses in multi-tenant deployments with forwarded auth.
- security: async background cache refresh goroutines now capture forwarded-auth credentials at request time via `snapshotForwardedAuth`, eliminating cross-tenant credential bleed when refresh workers use `context.Background()`.
- security: `multiTenantCacheKey` now includes auth fingerprint for `patterns`, `series`, `query`, and `query_range` endpoints.

## [1.22.4] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- ci: semgrep scan excludes three blanket false-positive rules for this codebase: `go.lang.security.audit.xss.no-direct-write-to-responsewriter` and `no-fprintf-to-responsewriter` (JSON/binary proxy writes are not XSS), `javascript.lang.security.detect-insecure-websocket` (JavaScript rule misapplied to Go).
- security: `nosemgrep` annotations added to four specific false-positive locations: `w.Write()` calls in `subquery.go`, `range_metric_compat.go`, and `query_range_windowing.go` (Content-Type set immediately before each write); `upgrader.Upgrade()` in `handleTail` (origin enforced via `tailUpgrader()` `CheckOrigin`); `translateQueryWithContext` in `handleDelete` (LogQL/LogsQL sent over HTTP, not SQL).
- ci: Trivy updated from `0.69.3` to `0.70.0` (`security-pr.yaml` docker image tag, `security-heavy.yaml` trivy-action pinned to `ed142fd` / `v0.36.0`).
- ci: replace `semgrep/semgrep-action@v1` (broken — uses removed `returntocorp/semgrep-agent:v1` Docker image) with `pip install semgrep==1.161.0` + `semgrep scan` CLI in `security-heavy.yaml`; adds SARIF upload step.
- ci: all GitHub Actions in `release.yaml` pinned to immutable commit SHAs to prevent supply-chain attacks via mutable version tags.
- ci: `govulncheck` pinned to `v1.1.4` in `ci.yaml`.
- docs: README "The Cost Case" and "Query Performance" sections rewritten with real production numbers (310 GiB/day, 1.4 cores, 6.1 GiB RAM) and cold-cache query latency table.

## [1.22.3] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- ci: Trivy updated from `0.69.3` to `0.70.0` (`security-pr.yaml` docker image tag, `security-heavy.yaml` trivy-action pinned to `ed142fd` / `v0.36.0`).
- ci: replace `semgrep/semgrep-action@v1` (broken — uses removed `returntocorp/semgrep-agent:v1` Docker image) with `pip install semgrep==1.161.0` + `semgrep scan` CLI in `security-heavy.yaml`; adds SARIF upload step.
- ci: all GitHub Actions in `release.yaml` pinned to immutable commit SHAs to prevent supply-chain attacks via mutable version tags.
- ci: `govulncheck` pinned to `v1.1.4` in `ci.yaml`.
- docs: README "The Cost Case" and "Query Performance" sections rewritten with real production numbers (310 GiB/day, 1.4 cores, 6.1 GiB RAM) and cold-cache query latency table.

## [1.22.2] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- ci: `permissions: contents: read` added at top level of `ci.yaml`, `compat-drilldown.yaml`, `compat-loki.yaml`, `compat-vl.yaml` (previously had no permission block, triggering OpenSSF Scorecard `Token-Permissions` = 0/10); write permissions in `auto-release.yaml` and `codeql.yaml` moved to job level so the top-level default is read-only.
- build: `cmd/healthcheck` minimal HTTP binary added to the distroless image (`/usr/local/bin/healthcheck`) — distroless has no shell or utilities; Docker health checks that used `CMD wget` failed inside the container. All 9 proxy service health checks in `test/e2e-compat/docker-compose.yml` and 3 in `test/e2e-fleet/docker-compose.yml` updated to use the new binary, restoring `service_healthy` dependency chains.
- ci: nginx tail-ingress Docker health check now uses a self-contained `/nginx-health` stub (returns 200 directly from nginx, no proxy_pass) — the previous health check probed `/ready` via `proxy_pass` to the backend proxy, which added a multi-hop round-trip and could mark the nginx container unhealthy even when it was serving correctly; the actual proxy-to-VL readiness path remains accessible via `/ready` and is verified by `wait_e2e_stack.sh`.
- ci: proxy service cache volumes replaced with `tmpfs` mounts in both e2e-compat and e2e-fleet docker-compose files — named Docker volumes are created root-owned, but the distroless image now runs as UID 65532 (nonroot); writing persistence files (`label-values-index.json`, `patterns-snapshot.json`, `proxy-*.db`) to root-owned volumes failed with `permission denied`. `tmpfs` provides a writable in-memory filesystem scoped to the container's user; no persistence across restarts is needed in ephemeral CI environments.
- test: `ingestRichTestData` base timestamp shifted to `time.Now().Add(-3 * time.Minute)` — Loki's ingester keeps recent entries in head blocks that are not immediately visible to metric queries (`sum_over_time`, `avg_over_time`, etc.); with `now := time.Now()` the 7 info-stream entries arrived within the current ingestion window, causing `TestQuerySemanticsMatrix` `*_over_time_unwrap` subtests to see mismatched cardinality between proxy (10 series) and Loki (6 series). Back-dating by 3 minutes guarantees all entries reside in chunk storage before queries run.

## [1.22.1] - 2026-04-28

### Security

- fix(security): Docker image switched from `alpine:3.22.2` to `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot` — Alpine's openssl, musl, zlib, and busybox packages carried 20+ unfixed CVEs (several CRITICAL/HIGH: CVE-2026-40200, CVE-2026-28387, CVE-2026-28388, CVE-2026-28389, CVE-2026-31789, CVE-2026-22184, et al). The statically-linked Go binary requires no libc or system packages; distroless provides only CA certificates and runs as a non-root user by default, eliminating all OS-layer CVE exposure.
- fix(security): website `uuid` transitive dependency forced to `>=14.0.0` via npm `overrides` — `webpack-dev-server` → `sockjs` depended on `uuid@^8.3.2` which is missing a buffer bounds check in `v3`/`v5`/`v6` when the `buf` parameter is provided (GitHub Advisory).

### Changed

- ci: semgrep action updated from deprecated `returntocorp/semgrep@v1` to `semgrep/semgrep-action@v1` — the `returntocorp` organisation was renamed to `semgrep`; the old tag no longer resolves, breaking the `Heavy / semgrep` CI job.
- ci: `github/codeql-action` bumped from `v3` to `v4` across `codeql.yaml`, `security-pr.yaml`, and `security-heavy.yaml` — v3 is scheduled for deprecation December 2026; affects Scorecard SAST check score.
- ci: Dockerfile `USER nonroot` instruction added explicitly — Trivy `DS-0002` flags Dockerfiles without a USER statement even when the distroless base image already defaults to UID 65532; the explicit declaration satisfies the static check.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- fix(cache): disk cache size cap no longer self-poisons on long-lived deployments — expired entries found on read are now deleted from bolt in a background goroutine so dead bytes are reclaimed; overwrites inside `Flush()` now deduct the existing stored size before checking the cap, preventing the cap from triggering before the effective working set is full.
- fix(proxy): `Shutdown` now stops the rate-limiter cleanup goroutine and the peer-cache discovery/read-ahead loops before flushing persistence state; previously these goroutines leaked on repeated start/stop cycles (tests, embeddings).
- fix(proxy): `/metrics` handler no longer double-buffers the full Prometheus output — it now streams directly from the metrics registry to the client and appends peer-cache metrics via a single `io.WriteString`, halving scrape-time memory cost on high-cardinality installs.
- fix(proxy): synthetic tail dedup window no longer allocates a new backing slice on every 4096-entry overflow — replaced `append([]string(nil), ...)` with an in-place `copy`+reslice, removing allocation and GC pressure in the hot tail path.
- fix(test): `TestHardening_SecurityHeaders` now wraps the mux through `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` (matching the production `wrapHandler` path) so header-clobbering regressions on the shipped server path are caught by tests; `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` extracted from `cmd/proxy` into `internal/proxy` for reuse.

### Testing

- test(reliability): 16 real integration tests covering all five reliability fixes — disk cache overwrite/expiry accounting (3 tests including a 20-cycle steady-state run), shutdown goroutine cleanup (2), metrics streaming correctness with/without peer cache (3), synthetic tail dedup window overflow invariants (3), and security header survival through backend responses on multiple endpoint types (3); all exercise live implementations with real disk/HTTP/goroutines rather than mocks. Docker Compose manual test runbook at `docs/manual-testing-reliability.md`.

## [1.21.2] - 2026-04-28

### Security

- fix(security): delete 30-day cap now enforced for RFC3339 timestamps — the guard previously only activated when start/end parsed as floats; RFC3339 inputs silently bypassed it and reached VL with an unbounded range. `parseDeleteTimestamp` now normalises all accepted formats (float-seconds, float-nanoseconds, RFC3339, RFC3339Nano) and rejects unrecognised input with HTTP 400.
- fix(security): cache and coalescing keys include a fingerprint of forwarded auth context — when `Authorization` or other per-user headers/cookies are forwarded to VL, cache and singleflight keys now include a 16-hex-char SHA-256 fingerprint of the forwarded values; without this, two users in the same tenant could receive each other's cached results.
- fix(security): VL backend credentials are not broadcast to ruler/alerts backends — `alertingBackendGetWithParams` previously called `applyBackendHeaders`, which applied `p.backendHeaders` (containing the VL `Authorization` from `-backend-basic-auth`) to requests to the ruler and alerts backends. These are separate services; VL credentials should not cross that trust boundary. A new `applyAlertingBackendHeaders` helper sets only `Accept-Encoding` and telemetry headers on alerting-backend requests.
- fix(security): proxy-set hardening headers are no longer overwritten by backend responses — `copyBackendHeaders` (new, replaces `copyHeaders` on the client-response path) skips `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`, `Cache-Control`, `Pragma`, and `Expires` when copying backend headers to the client, so security headers set by the `withSecurityHeaders` middleware cannot be silently erased by whatever the backend returns.

## [1.21.1] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed

- fix(proxy): deterministic log stream ordering for multi-window queries — `groupQueryRangeWindowEntries` now sorts streams by canonical label key and sorts per-stream values ascending by timestamp before emitting the response; previously Go map iteration produced random stream order on every request, causing visible shuffling in Grafana for time ranges spanning more than one query-split interval (default 15 minutes).

### Changed

- docs: update KNOWN_ISSUES, translation-reference, configuration, and roadmap to reflect features shipped through v1.21.x — remove stale "not implemented" entries for `label_replace`, `label_join`, `group()`, add CB tuning flags and `count_values()` error behavior.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-04-27

### Changed

- docs: restructure website sidebar navigation and add SEO landing pages; update marketing numbers to reflect current deployment scale.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- fix(translator): bare label matchers like `app="json-test"` (without braces) no longer translate to the malformed VL phrase filter `"app="json-test""`; the translator now returns an error for unbraced label matchers so they are rejected at query time rather than silently producing invalid VL LogsQL — was only visible when Grafana issued queries spanning 8+ hours (windowing prefilter threshold).

### Added

- feat(drilldown): infer `detected_level` from raw `_msg` content at read time to match Loki 3.x ingest-time level detection — handles JSON (`{"level":"error"}`), logfmt (`level=error`), and aliases (`severity`, `lvl`, `loglevel`); native VL `level` and OTel severity fields always take precedence. Stream grouping now splits by `detected_level` per Loki's behavior, so Drilldown and Explore show correct level breakdown for JSON and logfmt log lines without requiring an explicit `| json` or `| logfmt` parser in the query.
- fix(drilldown): `detected_field/{name}/values` now returns values for high-cardinality non-indexed fields (`trace_id`, `amount`, `ttl`, etc.) — VL returns `hits: 0` for fields it found but did not count; the proxy was filtering all zero-hit values, leaving Drilldown showing repeated field names instead of real values. Fix: when all returned values have `hits: 0` (VL's "found but uncounted" signal), include them; only filter zero-hit entries when a mix of positive and zero hits exists (stale indexed entries).
- feat(drilldown): volume API appends `| unpack_json from _msg | unpack_logfmt from _msg` to VL hits query when `detected_level` is a target label and no parser is present — enables Drilldown level breakdown for streams where level is inside `_msg` rather than a VL stream field.

- test(proxy): 14 JSON pretty-printing regression guards — table-driven `TestJSONPrettyPrint_GoFormatNeverEmitted` (9 collection-type sub-cases), plus full-pipeline `vlLogsToLokiStreams` tests for array `_msg`, mixed string/map entries in the same response, deeply nested JSON, and nil `_msg`; these tests will fail immediately if `fmt.Sprintf("%v")` is reinstated for map/slice values.
- test(translator): `TestBareLabelMatcherMustNotProduceDoubleQuotedString` and `TestBracedLabelMatcherTranslatesToVLFieldFilter` prevent regression of the bare-label-matcher translation bug.
- test(proxy): `TestQueryRange_DoesNotEmitDoubleQuotedSelectorToVL` — end-to-end test with fake VL backend over a 12-hour range (triggers windowing prefilter) asserting no query to VL contains the `"app="json-test""` double-quoted form.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-04-27

### Fixed

- fix(proxy): stable log stream ordering on repeated refreshes — Go map iteration was non-deterministic, causing entire streams to swap positions between requests; fixed by tracking insertion order and iterating in that order when building the response.
- fix(proxy): `stringifyEntryValue` now JSON-marshals `map[string]interface{}` and `[]interface{}` values instead of using `fmt.Sprintf("%v")`; VL-parsed JSON objects come back as valid JSON strings so Grafana can detect and pretty-print log lines.
- fix(e2e): `ensureRangeMetricCompatData` now waits for `{app="range-metric-counter"}` chunks to seal in Loki (up to 90 s) instead of sleeping 3 s; prevents spurious `sum_rate_by_app` series-count mismatches in the query semantics matrix test.

### Added

- test(proxy): 16 hardening tests for stream ordering determinism (same result across 15 repeated calls) and `stringifyEntryValue` JSON-object handling (map/slice values produce valid JSON, not `map[k:v]`).

### Documentation

- docs: fix comparison table in README — "15x less" figure is CPU, not Disk, per VictoriaLogs vendor benchmarks.
- docs(bench): clarify VL native heavy-workload CPU note — "3.5× more total CPU; 18.5× more throughput — 5.3× more efficient per request" replaces the misleading "3.5× more CPU than Loki".
- docs(website): restructure Docusaurus sidebar into 11 named category groups (Start Here, Architecture, Configuration, Cost & Comparison, Compatibility, Operations, Caching, Observability, Testing, Reference, Runbooks); add sidebar_label and description frontmatter to all docs.
- docs(website): update marketing pages with current measured numbers — proxy throughput (1,006–1,717× vs Loki), 54.9× real-tested compression, 4-tier cache stack, circuit breaker (30s/5-failure), 81.6% prefilter savings, resource sizing (33 vCPU / 70 GiB vs 431 vCPU / 857 GiB).
- docs(website): add two new SEO pages — Kubernetes deployment guide with Helm install snippet and resource sizing table; OTel Collector config guide with field mapping table, translation modes, and detected_fields in Grafana Explore/Drilldown.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- bench(pprof): `loki-bench` captures CPU, heap, alloc, and goroutine profiles from proxy `/debug/pprof/*` endpoints during each run; profiles written to `bench/results/pprof/<workload>-c<N>-<target>-<type>.pprof` for flamegraph analysis.
- bench(cache-disabled): added `-cache-disabled` flag to the proxy so `run-comparison.sh` can spawn a confirmed zero-cache target without TTL tricks; this is the fourth target in the 4-way comparison (`loki`, `proxy-warm`, `proxy-cold`, `vl-native`).
- bench(verify): added `--verify` flag to `loki-bench` for cross-target result correctness validation before benchmarking.

### Fixed

- fix(circuitbreaker): replace consecutive failure counting with a sliding time-window (default 30 s, tunable via `-cb-window-duration`); sporadic slow-query connection resets from VictoriaLogs no longer trip the breaker during cold-cache warmup — only a burst of N failures within the window opens the circuit.
- fix(circuitbreaker): couple circuit breaker with request coalescing via `DoWithGuard`; when the breaker is open the CB probe starts one in-flight call and all simultaneous identical requests join it rather than each failing with 503 — eliminates retry amplification under VL load. Circuit breaker errors now return HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) instead of 502.
- feat(coalescer): add `-coalescer-disabled` flag to bypass singleflight for benchmarking raw translation overhead; coalescer remains active by default even with `-cache-disabled` to protect VL from thundering-herd.

## [1.17.4] - 2026-04-26

### Performance

- perf(proxy): cache parsed stream label maps by `_stream` string value to eliminate redundant label parsing on repeated log entries; copy on write to prevent cache mutation bugs.
- perf(proxy): reuse intermediate map in `translateStatsResponseLabelsWithContext` across loop iterations to reduce per-result allocations (~27% of heap at c=100).
- perf(postprocess): use `sync.Pool` for tokenizer slice buffers in `patternLineTokenizer.Tokenize` to eliminate per-call allocations (~6.6 GB saved at c=100).

## [1.17.3] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- fix(e2e): add `_msg` field to all JSON-format log generators so VictoriaLogs stores the human-readable message correctly and Grafana renders JSON service logs consistently with Loki.

### Observability

- dashboard/ops: regroup the packaged metrics dashboard into explicit SLO/SLI health, client→proxy→VL operational, and deep proxy internals sections for faster incident triage and tuning.

### Documentation

- docs: comprehensive README rewrite focused on production-readiness, cost comparison, quick setup, and strongest capabilities.
- docs/ops: document the new dashboard structure and triage flow in observability and operations guides.
- docs(bench): update benchmarks.md with 4-way comparison results (warm/cold proxy, VL native, Loki), Apple M5 Pro hardware spec, warmup design notes, and VictoriaLogs long-range tuning guide.

### Performance

- bench: warmup phase now runs at full benchmark concurrency with the same jitter as the real run, so the proxy cache is populated across the same time-window space the benchmark will query; warmup time is never counted in results.
- e2e(vl): add VictoriaLogs block-cache and memory tuning flags to docker-compose (`-blockcache.missesBeforeCaching=1`, `-internStringCacheExpireDuration=15m`, `-memory.allowedPercent=75`) to improve repeated-query performance.
## [1.17.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- fix(log-generator): split JSON log entries by their actual content `level` before pushing to VictoriaLogs streams, eliminating stream-label/content mismatch that caused `detected_level=error` filters to return `warn` entries.
- fix(detected_fields): skip nested JSON objects and arrays from the body-scan detected fields list; `service={"name":"..."}` no longer appears as a filterable field, preventing Grafana Drilldown field breakdown from breaking.
- fix(metrics): remove raw `level` label from metric aggregation results when `detected_level` is synthesized from it, so `sum by (detected_level)` returns only `{detected_level:"error"}` matching Loki's output; this unblocks the Drilldown include button for `detected_level` values.
- fix(translator): silently drop bare `| unwrap` with no field name instead of returning an error; Grafana query builder emits this while the user is selecting a field.
- fix(service-names): stop picking up logfmt-parsed document fields (e.g. `job=sync-users`) as service names when stream label inventory is available; only dotted OTel-style names are read from full field inventory in that case.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- fix(detected_fields): infer `int`/`float` types for logfmt string values so Grafana's unwrap field selector correctly lists numeric fields.
- fix(detected_fields): strip bare `| unwrap` (without field name) from field detection queries, preventing VictoriaLogs parse errors when Grafana sends an incomplete query to the `detected_fields` endpoint.
- fix(compat): `| json | status >= 400` no longer incorrectly rejected as a binary op on a log query by the LogQL syntax validator.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- feat(compat): LogQL syntax validation that returns Loki-compatible HTTP 400 errors for invalid queries (binary ops on log expressions, malformed selectors, empty queries).

### Fixed

- fix(compat): label filter stages like `| json | status >= 400` no longer incorrectly rejected by syntax validator.
- fix(config): increase max_query_series from 500 to 5000 to prevent false series truncation in high-cardinality environments.

### Tests

- test(parity): exhaustive LogQL parity machine with 116 cases covering all LogQL operations — error parity (31 cases) and query parity (85 cases).

## [1.15.0] - 2026-04-25

### Added

- feat(otel): hierarchical OTel detection for detected_fields — detects OTel-instrumented services from stream labels (service.name, k8s.*, deployment.*, telemetry.*) and correctly exposes both dotted and underscore alias forms in detected_fields API.
- feat(otel): conditional service_name suppression — synthetic service_name is suppressed for non-OTel data but exposed as alias pair for OTel data with real service.name in stream labels.
- feat(compat): add Grafana 13.x to Drilldown RuntimeFamilyContracts (same contract as 12.x).

### Fixed

- fix(detected_fields): service_name was incorrectly appearing in detected_fields for non-OTel data (e.g., api-gateway) — now unconditionally suppressed and only re-added for OTel data with real service.name.
- fix(detected_fields): service_name alias not exposed in MetadataFieldModeTranslated — now correctly creates alias entry when dotted source is absent.
- fix(tests): semantics matrix queries isolated from continuous log generator using env=production filter for deterministic line/series count comparisons.

### Tests

- e2e/otel: add comprehensive OTel test data covering 4 delivery mechanisms — Loki push with dotted labels, OTel attributes in message JSON, pre-translated underscore conventions.
- e2e/ui-comprehensive: add 30+ comprehensive Playwright tests covering all Loki Explorer UI interactions (page load, query editor, field explorer, filters, time range picker, drilldown integration, edge cases).
- e2e/ui-performance: add performance baseline tests measuring page load (<3s), query response (<5s), UI interactions (<500ms), label selector (<1s), and rapid filter changes (<5s).

### Documentation

- docs: create standalone `performance-testing-guide.md` with comprehensive guide for running, interpreting, and tracking performance tests locally and in CI.
- docs: update `testing.md` with performance testing section, CI shard documentation, and new test file inventory.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-04-24

### Tests

- e2e/missing-ops: add dual-write parity tests for `offset`, `unpack`, `|>`/`!>` pattern match, `unwrap duration()`/`bytes()`, and `label_replace()` comparing Loki vs proxy responses.
- e2e/playwright: add 12 Explore operations browser tests (parsers, formatters, metric queries, line filters, aggregations) in new `explore-ops` CI shard.
- e2e/ci: add 5th e2e-compat group (`semantics`) running query semantics matrix, operations matrix, range metric compat, and clickout parity on every PR.
- e2e/testdata: add duration/bytes, pattern-matchable, and unpack-compatible test data streams for missing operation coverage.

### Documentation

- docs: create standalone `testing-e2e-guide.md` for e2e infrastructure (stack setup, dual-write pattern, adding tests, proxy variants, CI integration, debugging).
- docs: update `compatibility-loki.md` with `offset`, `unpack`, `unwrap` modifier, `label_replace()`, and `|>` edge case coverage.
- docs: update `translation-reference.md` with `offset` (gap), `label_replace()` (gap), `unwrap duration()/bytes()`, and `|>` translation rows.
- docs: update `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` with `offset` directive (silently stripped) and `label_replace()` (not implemented) behavioral differences.

## [1.13.2] - 2026-04-23

### Bug Fixes

- metrics/range-selectors: align Grafana clickout range-selector handling closer to Loki behavior by normalizing braced selector templates (`${__interval}` variants), honoring Loki-style duration units (`d/w/y`) in proxy compatibility paths, and ensuring stats compatibility paths use token-resolved original queries instead of raw unresolved request text.
- metrics/range-selectors: normalize missing-unwrap error handling in compatibility paths so explicit unwrap-required range functions return stable Loki-compatible bad-data errors instead of falling through to generic invalid-range responses.

### Tests

- e2e/clickout: add Grafana `/api/ds/query` parity coverage for range-metric functions (missing-unwrap 400 parity and unwrap + `$__auto` success parity) across direct Loki and Loki-via-proxy datasources.
- e2e/grafana-clickout: add selector-option parity coverage for `sum_over_time(... | unwrap ...)` across `$__auto`, `$__interval`, `${__interval}`, and fixed window options (`5m`, `1h`, `1d`) against direct Loki.
- compat/helpers: expand unit coverage for Prometheus/Loki duration parsing (`1d`, mixed `w/d/h`), braced Grafana token resolution, and selector-token recognition.

## [1.13.1] - 2026-04-23

## [1.13.0] - 2026-04-23

### Bug Fixes

- metrics/query-range-compat: route parser-stage metric queries (translated `unpack_*` / `extract*`) through proxy-side range evaluation for `query` and `query_range`, preserving parser label cardinality and unwrap semantics when direct `stats_query(_range)` behavior diverges from Loki.
- metrics/rate-counter: force `rate_counter` onto the compatibility path so counter-reset-aware behavior is consistent across parser and non-parser shapes instead of depending on backend parser acceptance.
- query-range/windowing: return explicit Loki-style backend errors when split-window fetches fail after retries instead of silently falling back to full-range direct query execution.
- query-range/error-contract: keep failure shape stable for Grafana and API clients by surfacing the real upstream failure class on split execution errors.
- drilldown/cache: normalize empty detected-field-value refresh payloads to `[]` (not `null`) to keep downstream consumers stable during cache refreshes.

### Tests

- compat/query-range: add parser-stage/manual evaluation coverage for `rate`, `bytes_rate`, `first_over_time`, `quantile_over_time`, and `rate_counter`, and keep `stdvar_over_time` compatibility covered through matrix/binary evaluation paths.
- compat/query-range: add explicit parser-probe and path-selection coverage to enforce when manual compatibility evaluation is required vs when backend stats execution remains valid.
- query-range/windowing: add regressions proving split-window failures return upstream errors and transient per-window backend failures are retried.
- drilldown/compat: harden parser-probe expectations so metric compatibility tests accept both direct stats and manual compatibility execution paths while still enforcing "single working parser" behavior.

### Documentation

- docs/translation-reference: document `rate_counter` translation and parser-stage range-metric compatibility behavior, including path-selection rules for manual evaluation vs single-shot `stats_query_range`.
- docs/testing: expand required matrix edge cases for parser-stage range metrics, `rate_counter`, unwrap error shapes, and comparison expectations across Loki/proxy parity checks.

## [1.12.3] - 2026-04-23

### Bug Fixes

- metrics/compat: harden range-function compatibility by requiring explicit `| unwrap <field>` for unwrap-dependent range functions, resolve Grafana range template selectors (`$__auto`, `$__interval`, `$__rate_interval`, `$__range*`) before compatibility handling, and reject unsupported bare metric range queries early instead of silently falling through.
- metrics/compat: add `rate_counter(...)` support on parser+unwrap compatibility paths, including counter-reset aware rate calculation.

### Tests

- proxy/translator: add regressions for unwrap-required function errors, Grafana template token resolution, parser probe unquoting, template-window resolution for `rate_counter`, and counter-reset handling in compatibility window evaluation.

## [1.12.2] - 2026-04-21

### Bug Fixes

- chart: tolerate reserved scalar `env` values by rendering list-typed `env`/`envFrom` only when they are real lists, and add `extraEnv` / `extraEnvFrom` compatibility aliases for chart consumers that need explicit container env injection without colliding with scalar environment selectors.

### Tests

- chart/ci: add a Helm render regression for scalar `env` combined with `extraEnv` / `extraEnvFrom` so the manifest shape stays valid in CI.

## [1.12.1] - 2026-04-21

### Bug Fixes

- metrics/query-range: stop injecting synthetic `service_name="unknown_service"` into metric `query`/`query_range` responses when the result labelset has no real service signal (for example `sum by(cluster)(rate(...))`).
- drilldown/fields: suppress high-cardinality terminal timestamp fields (`timestamp_end`, `observed_timestamp_end`) from `detected_fields` responses to keep Drilldown field discovery stable under repeated refreshes.

### Tests

- drilldown/compat: add unit and e2e regressions for non-service metric aggregations (no synthetic `unknown_service`) and detected-field suppression of terminal timestamp keys.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-04-21

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown/volume: stop injecting synthetic `service_name="unknown_service"` into `index/volume` and `index/volume_range` buckets when requests are grouped by non-service labels (for example `cluster`), while preserving service-aware grouping behavior.
- drilldown/volume: honor Drilldown grouping hints (`drillDownLabel`, `fieldBy`, and `var-fieldBy`) as target-label fallbacks when `targetLabels` is omitted, so field/label include-exclude actions keep grouping on the selected dimension instead of falling back to selector-order inference.
- translator/metrics: make `rate` and `bytes_rate` preserve Loki per-second semantics via window normalization, make parser+unwrap metric paths preserve Loki-like cardinality with outer-aggregation composition, emit VictoriaLogs-compatible byte aggregations via `sum_len(_msg)`, and implement `stdvar_over_time` via proxy-side `stddev^2` composition to avoid backend `stdvar` parser failures.
- proxy/binary-metrics: fix scalar and binary post-processing to mutate both legacy `results` payloads and Prometheus-style `data.result` payloads (including instant-vector `value` samples), preventing silent no-op arithmetic on valid `stats_query` responses.

### Tests

- drilldown/volume: add regression coverage for inferred non-service target labels (no synthetic `unknown_service`) and for Drilldown `fieldBy` fallback mapping on both vector and matrix volume endpoints.
- compat/matrix: add operation/filter/function matrix coverage across translator and proxy scalar paths, with deterministic e2e checks for binary scalar operators, filter operators, and metric function families (cross-engine parity for compatible functions plus proxy-local expected-value checks where semantics intentionally differ), and add scalar/binary fuzz coverage for response-shape robustness.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-04-21

### Bug Fixes

- compat/loki: preserve Loki semantics for bare parser-derived metric queries and `absent_over_time(...)` on the direct `query` and `query_range` paths so valid Loki operations keep their parser-derived label cardinality, unwrap behavior, and empty-series semantics instead of collapsing into proxy-specific aggregated fallback results.

### Changed

- release/metadata: synchronized release metadata for v1.10.2.

### Tests

- compat/loki: make the query-semantics matrix and operation inventory required in CI, expand positive and negative Loki operation coverage across parser pipelines, unwrap range functions, boolean/set operators, and invalid log/metric combinations, and add unit coverage for the bare parser metric and `absent_over_time(...)` compatibility handlers plus cache-tier coverage for the current mainline helper cache paths.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-04-20

### Bug Fixes

- chart/helm: quote rendered container args in the chart deployment template so values containing JSON, commas, colons, or embedded delimiters survive Helm rendering unchanged instead of being split or reinterpreted by YAML parsing.
- proxy/wrapping: normalize wrapped stats responses to always include Loki `data.resultType` and `data.result` (including fallback mapping from legacy/top-level `results`) so Grafana Loki datasource queries no longer fail with `no resultType found` when backend payloads omit result metadata.

### Tests

- chart/ci: add a quoted-args Helm template regression case covering structured `extraArgs` values such as auth pairs, field-mapping JSON, and tenant limit JSON blobs.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-20

### Bug Fixes

- cache/tiering: move helper/read caches onto shared fresh reads with local-memory plus local-disk persistence, keep stale fallback local-first, and expose per-tier cache lookup metrics.
- cache/keys: canonicalize helper/read cache keys across query-param ordering and alias pairs such as `from`/`start`, `to`/`end`, and `q`/`search`, plus normalize effective detected-field limits so Grafana refreshes can reuse the same helper cache entries instead of churning near-identical keys.
- drilldown/discovery: stop relaxing helper discovery queries after a successful empty primary result for label names, label values, native field values, and detected-label scans; successful empty strict detected-field value resolution now stays strict instead of broadening into relaxed query data, and `service_name` metadata lookup stays on metadata endpoints instead of spilling into streams/scans when metadata is sufficient.
- metrics/cache: promote cache-tier stats into the shared metrics pipeline so `/metrics` and OTLP now export the same L1/L2/L3 request, hit, miss, stale-hit, backend-fallthrough, object, and byte series instead of keeping them as proxy-local text-only metrics.
- peer/persistence: advertise peer write-through compression support on existing GET/hot responses, opportunistically compress owner write-through pushes only when the remote peer has confirmed support, accept compressed peer cache POST bodies, request compressed peer snapshot warm responses, and skip periodic snapshot rewrites when the on-disk patterns or label-values payload is unchanged.

### Tests

- cache/tiering: add regression coverage for TTL-aware disk fresh/stale reads, shared L2 promotion into L1, and helper cache locality.
- discovery/keys: add regression coverage for canonical helper cache keys, for stopping relaxed discovery fallback after a successful empty primary result, and for OTLP/Prometheus cache-tier metric export.
- peer/persistence: add regression coverage for compressed peer write-through/set round trips, compressed peer snapshot warm fetches, and skipping unchanged periodic snapshot rewrites.

## [1.9.6] - 2026-04-20

### Bug Fixes

- read-path/hardening: stop converting backend failures on Drilldown `detected_fields`, `detected_labels`, detected field values, `/index/volume`, and `/index/volume_range` into empty success payloads; these handlers now serve stale last-good cache entries when available and otherwise return real upstream-style errors, and volume helpers now reject non-success `/select/logsql/hits` responses instead of silently parsing them as empty data.

### Tests

- drilldown/cache: add regression coverage for stale-on-error recovery on detected fields, detected labels, detected field values, and near-now volume refreshes, plus cache coverage for reusing expired L1 entries as last-good fallback data.

## [1.9.5] - 2026-04-20

### Bug Fixes

- patterns/persistence: store query-level compact pattern snapshots for persistence instead of range-shaped filled payload variants, reducing snapshot entry churn and write amplification when the same logical Drilldown query is refreshed across different time windows.

## [1.9.4] - 2026-04-20

### Bug Fixes

- query-range/metrics: stop splitting metric `query_range` requests into multiple backend `stats_query_range` windows, keeping the read path aligned with the documented log-only windowing contract and reducing avoidable VL request fanout for Drilldown and Explore metric panels.

### Tests

- patterns/e2e: compare bursty mixed-pattern Drilldown compatibility by preserved signal and time bounds instead of demanding near-identical sparse bucket coverage between native Loki and grouped proxy mining.

## [1.9.3] - 2026-04-20

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown/discovery: ignore zero-hit native `field_values` entries so detected field value pickers stop advertising values that are not actually present in the current selector and time window, and query-escape peer-cache GET/SET keys so discovery caches with embedded query strings survive peer transport correctly instead of truncating on `&`-style separators.

### Tests

- drilldown/cache: add regression coverage for zero-hit native detected field values and for peer-cache fetch/write-through round trips using realistic cache keys that include encoded query fragments.

## [1.9.2] - 2026-04-19

### Bug Fixes

- cache/read-path: keep full `query_range`, label, volume, and detected-* response caches local to the serving pod when those handlers only read cache through L1 `GetWithTTL`, avoiding redundant disk writes and peer write-through churn that do not provide any fallback benefit.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-04-19

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown/metrics: treat synthetic `service_name!=""` filters as "any service source field is populated" instead of requiring every possible backing field to be non-empty, restoring Grafana Drilldown label-card metric queries such as `sum(count_over_time({service_name="argocd",service_name != ""}[5s])) by (service_name)`.

### Tests

- drilldown/translator: add regression coverage for synthetic `service_name` empty and non-empty matcher translation, including the exact Drilldown grouped `query_range` label-card shape used by Grafana.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-19

### Features

- ci/security: add layered GitHub Actions security lanes with fast PR blockers for secrets, SAST, supply-chain, workflow, and container linting, plus runtime ZAP coverage on PRs and deeper scheduled scanning with SBOM, Semgrep, fuzzing, and curated Nuclei checks.

### Bug Fixes

- proxy/security: apply baseline hardening headers (`nosniff`, frame-deny, same-origin resource policy, and non-cacheable responses) across normal, error, and disabled-admin responses, keep the container runtime non-root, and tighten the security test fixtures so the static scanners stay focused on actionable findings.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-19

### Bug Fixes

- query-range/cache: keep window fragment results and prefilter hit estimates local to the serving pod instead of distributing those short-lived scratch entries through peer-cache write-through, reducing avoidable owner hot spots, network churn, and disk activity during Drilldown or Explore fanout.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-19

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown/detected-labels: recover `service_name` in broad Drilldown label discovery when native stream labels collapse to `unknown_service` by deriving service identity from structured metadata fields such as `service.name` during scan fallback and replacing incomplete native summaries with scanned service names.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-19

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown/metadata: restore `service_name` label discovery by preferring native field metadata over stream scans, and retry relaxed query candidates for labels, label values, and detected-label fallbacks when parser-heavy Drilldown queries return empty metadata.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-18

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown/fields: retry native field and stream discovery with relaxed candidates when parser or comparison stages make Drilldown field lookups unstable, treat backend `5xx` scan responses as failed windows instead of empty results, and preserve native-only fallback for structured metadata without leaking indexed labels.
- peer-cache/persistence: keep persisted patterns and label-values snapshot blobs local instead of distributing them through the ring owner path, merge label-values startup warm state directly from peer-local snapshots, and use the correct peer auth header during snapshot fetches so fleet warmups stay compatible when `peer-auth-token` is enabled.

### Tests

- drilldown: add regression coverage for duration-filtered detected field and detected field value requests so future changes catch strict-vs-relaxed discovery regressions before release.
- cache/persistence: add regression coverage proving fleet snapshot blobs skip write-through owner pushes and that peer-warmed label-values state merges correctly under shared peer auth.

## [1.6.3] - 2026-04-17

### Features

- helm/chart: add a reusable `customManifests` hook so downstream installs can render extra Kubernetes resources with full chart context without forking chart templates.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-17

### Bug Fixes

- patterns/read-path: reduce dense short-range sampling fanout so 30-minute pattern refreshes stay bounded instead of exploding into excessive backend raw-log window fetches.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-17

### Bug Fixes

- proxy/logging: emit build identity on startup and listener bind, carry real version/revision/build-time metadata in release artifacts, add restore/persist duration logging for patterns and label-values snapshots, downgrade `4xx` request errors to warn, and keep verbose per-type request breakdown maps at debug level while warning when peer cache runs without a shared auth token.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-17

### Features

- patterns/observability: add read-path quality counters, last-response gauges, persisted snapshot inventory gauges, and disk/peer snapshot byte exchange metrics so fleet monitoring can distinguish sparse real pattern activity from degraded mining or restore behavior.

### Bug Fixes

- patterns/read-path: improve mining fidelity with typed placeholders, stronger cross-window merging, and bounded second-pass widening for capped windows so rare and high-cardinality pattern families stay closer to native Loki behavior on reads.

### Tests

- patterns: expand native-Loki-vs-proxy A/B coverage with bursty mixed-pattern and high-cardinality variable fixtures in addition to the stable-stream parity check.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-17

### Bug Fixes

- translator/proxy: remove off-by-one line scanners flagged by CodeQL in proxy and Drilldown helpers, and tighten translator helper coverage plus error-path tests to keep the reliability/maintainability sweep green.

### Tests

- e2e: replace brittle fixed sleeps with bounded polling in long-range Drilldown and patterns compatibility tests, add explicit dense-bucket boundary coverage, and simplify native patterns seed quoting to use the standard library directly.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-17

### Bug Fixes

- patterns/drilldown: make proxy read-path pattern mining match native Loki pattern coverage more closely by preserving stable fixed-prefix patterns, avoiding split-window overlap on backend raw log fetches, and dropping the synthetic trailing zero bucket beyond the last observed sample.

## [1.4.6] - 2026-04-16

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown/volume: compensate split `stats_query_range` metric windows by extending backend end timestamps by one step and trimming the extra point back to the requested range, so 2-day Explore and Drilldown volume queries stay dense across 24h boundaries.

## [1.4.5] - 2026-04-16

### Bug Fixes

- query-range/windowing: fall back from the windowed log `query_range` path to the direct full-range Loki-compatible query when per-window fetches exhaust retries, instead of surfacing the windowed-path failure immediately.

## [1.4.4] - 2026-04-16

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown/step-parsing: normalize float-second `step` values before forwarding them to backend volume and patterns requests, and reuse the same positive-duration parsing in zero-fill plus patterns bucketing so float-second cadences stay dense and aligned.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-04-16

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown/query-range: split long `stats_query_range` metric requests into aligned VL windows before merging them back into one Loki-shaped matrix response, and translate Drilldown pattern hover queries that use Loki pattern line filters (`|>`, `!>`) plus backtick-quoted `pattern`/`extract`/`regexp` stages into VL-compatible syntax.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-16

### Features

- peer-cache/metrics: add configurable peer fetch timeout wiring (`peer-timeout`) and per-reason peer fetch error counters so peer cache failures are no longer a single opaque `errors_total` bucket.

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown: keep 7-day minute `volume_range` requests zero-filled beyond the old 10k-bucket ceiling, and make dense short-range patterns fan out enough to avoid the “one visible burst every ~40 minutes” sampling shape.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-16

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown: translate Loki pattern-match filters (`|>`, `!>`) into VictoriaLogs regex filters so pattern stats queries compile correctly, and accept both `start/end` and `from/to` on volume endpoints so long-range volume buckets remain dense.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-16

### Features

- observability: add per-request fanout and proxy-internal operation telemetry to logs, Prometheus, OTLP export, bundled dashboard panels, and first-class Helm chart values for the new observability/runtime flags.

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown/patterns: keep long-range Drilldown patterns and volume queries dense across `>24h` windows by boosting dense per-window sampling and adding 48h regression coverage.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-16

### Bug Fixes

- security/runtime: require explicit `tenant.allow-global` for wildcard tenant bypass, add bounded peer/backend body reads plus `ReadHeaderTimeout`, hide sensitive metrics labels by default, and harden admin/debug surfaces.

### Documentation

- security/docs: document explicit wildcard-tenant opt-in, low-cardinality default metrics export, `/metrics` concurrency bounds, and the Go `1.26.2` baseline.

### Tests

- security/metrics: add coverage for wildcard-tenant rejection, admin exposure validation, `ReadHeaderTimeout`, and sensitive-metrics export opt-in.

### CI

- toolchain/security: bump repo and workflow Go version to `1.26.2`, add `govulncheck` to CI, and override the docs-site `serialize-javascript` dependency to the non-vulnerable line.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-15

### Features

- proxy: add downstream HTTP/1.x connection rotation, connection-state metrics, and frontend compression controls to redistribute sticky Loki-compatible clients while keeping upstream backend reuse warm.

### Bug Fixes

- query-range/read path: reduce translation buffering and repeated frontend gzip work by reusing hot compat-cache encodings, moving log-query conversion to a one-pass reader path, and bounding miss-path capture memory.
- query-range/patterns: reuse query response pattern extraction for autodetected pattern warming and keep `volume_range` zero-filled across the full requested range.
- security/runtime: require explicit `tenant.allow-global` for wildcard tenant bypass, add bounded peer/backend body reads plus `ReadHeaderTimeout`, hide sensitive metrics labels by default, and harden admin/debug surfaces.

### Documentation

- dashboards/config docs: refresh bundled operational dashboard JSON and document the client-facing gzip defaults and connection-redistribution controls.
- security/docs: document explicit wildcard-tenant opt-in, low-cardinality default metrics export, `/metrics` concurrency bounds, and the Go `1.26.2` baseline.

### Tests

- proxy/compression: add regression coverage for the one-pass reader conversion path, pattern collection on reader-backed query results, and frontend `nosniff` hardening on compressed responses.
- security/metrics: add coverage for wildcard-tenant rejection, admin exposure validation, `ReadHeaderTimeout`, and sensitive-metrics export opt-in.

### CI

- toolchain/security: bump repo and workflow Go version to `1.26.2`, add `govulncheck` to CI, and override the docs-site `serialize-javascript` dependency to the non-vulnerable line.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-15

### Features

- peer cache: add optional owner write-through replication (`/_cache/set`) so non-owner replicas can proactively warm ring owners under skewed client traffic, with bounded TTL gating (`peer-write-through`, `peer-write-through-min-ttl`) and peer token support on both peer endpoints.
- metrics: expose peer write-through counters (`loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_write_through_pushes_total`, `loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_write_through_errors_total`) for fleet-cache redistribution observability.
- peer cache: enable owner write-through by default (`peer-write-through=true`) so skewed client traffic warms owner shards without extra rollout tuning.
- peer cache: add bounded hot read-ahead with owner hot-index endpoint (`/_cache/hot`), top-N selection, key/byte/concurrency budgets, tenant-fair prefetch selection, jittered periodic pulls, and backoff-aware anti-storm behavior.
- peer cache: expose read-ahead metrics (`*_hot_index_requests_total`, `*_hot_index_errors_total`, `*_read_ahead_prefetches_total`, `*_read_ahead_prefetch_bytes_total`, `*_read_ahead_budget_drops_total`, `*_read_ahead_tenant_skips_total`) and wire runtime flags for interval/jitter/top-N/budgets/fair-share/backoff.

### Bug Fixes

- cache persistence: skip duplicate L2 disk writes for `patterns:*` keys because patterns already use dedicated snapshot persistence, reducing avoidable local disk write pressure.
- e2e dense patterns harness: fix synthetic timestamp generation overflow for large ranges/high line counts so 7d dense repro runs generate valid evenly distributed data instead of corrupted short-tail timestamps.
- cache write path: clamp non-owner local shadow TTL and skip non-owner L2 disk writes when write-through is enabled, reducing hot-pod disk amplification while preserving owner cache warmth.

### Documentation

- fleet-cache/config docs and Helm defaults: document default owner write-through behavior, `peer-write-through*` flags, and peer token requirements on both `/_cache/get` and `/_cache/set`.
- fleet cache docs: add explicit collapse-forwarding status and a bounded hot-read-ahead design proposal (budgets, jitter, anti-storm guardrails, and validation plan).
- docs: extend bounded hot-read-ahead proposal with planned flag surface, phased rollout plan, and proposed observability metrics for future regression gates.

### Tests

- cache: add regression tests for hot-index serving and bounded tenant-fair read-ahead prefetch behavior.
- benchmarks: add cache-path benchmarks for `TopHotKeys` and bounded `PeerCache` read-ahead cycle performance.

### CI

- ci: add `internal/cache` coverage guard (`>=79.0%`) in the main test workflow.
- ci: add cache benchmark regression guard in CI for hot read-ahead and cache hot paths, with threshold checks and job summary output.
- auto-release: add PR size/scope-aware version bump heuristics so large runtime-impacting PRs (for example `size/XL` with proxy/cache scopes) auto-promote from patch to minor when no explicit release label overrides are set.

## [1.0.24] - 2026-04-15

### Bug Fixes

- backend detection: add startup fallback version sensing from `/metrics` (`vm_app_version`/`victorialogs_build_info`) when upstream proxies strip version headers, and infer conservative capability profiles from runtime endpoint probes when explicit semver is unavailable.
- drilldown-limits: expose backend detection state (`backend_version_source`, `backend_version_semver`, `backend_capability_profile`) for operational verification and e2e assertions.

### Tests

- add regression tests for backend version fallback detection (`/metrics`), fallback min-version enforcement, endpoint-probed capability inference, and backend detection fields in drilldown limits.
- add e2e compose coverage for backend/grafana detection surfaces across VictoriaLogs `v1.50.0` and `v1.49.0`.
- add e2e compose coverage for backend/grafana detection when VictoriaLogs is fronted by `vmauth` (`Loki -> proxy -> vmauth -> VictoriaLogs`) to better match production routing topology.

## [1.0.23] - 2026-04-15

## [1.0.22] - 2026-04-14

### Bug Fixes

- ci: remove an unused Grafana surface helper that triggered lint failure.
- tests: harden long-range patterns contract tests against race conditions under parallel window fanout (`-race`).

## [1.0.21] - 2026-04-14

### Bug Fixes

- patterns: keep `/loki/api/v1/patterns` charts full-range on large scopes by parsing relative range boundaries and adaptively coarsening overly dense bucket grids instead of returning sparse short-tail samples.
- patterns: harden long-range windowed extraction by using direct `query_range` fanout per window and bounded per-window limits, avoiding helper-path stalls and preserving deterministic dense-range coverage.
- compatibility gate: enforce minimum supported VictoriaLogs version at startup (with explicit unsafe bypass flag) and add version-sensed runtime capability profiles for stream metadata and dense pattern windowing paths.
- metadata browse: add version-gated (`v1.49+`) forwarding of `q` + `filter=substring` to VictoriaLogs `field_*`/`stream_field_*` endpoints, with safe fallback behavior for older versions.
- cache freshness: add near-now stale-cache bypass controls (`recent-tail-refresh-*`) for `query_range`, `index/volume`, and `index/volume_range` to reduce refresh gaps without sacrificing long-lived historical cache reuse.

### Tests

- add regression coverage for VictoriaLogs version compatibility gate edge paths (missing version headers, health probe failure, non-success health status).
- add cache freshness and persistence hardening tests for near-now cache bypass decisions, volume cache bypass behavior, patterns snapshot compaction, and patterns persistence loop startup/shutdown.

### Documentation

- compatibility matrix: bump Logs Drilldown contract coverage to `2.0.3` and VictoriaLogs pinned runtime coverage to `v1.50.0`, including updated support-band notes and pinned commit references.
- compatibility matrix/docs: add VictoriaLogs runtime capability profiles (version-sensed feature gates) and document which LogSQL optimizations are enabled per version family.
- compatibility matrix/docs: add Grafana Loki datasource compatibility profiles and Drilldown `v1`/`v2` capability profiles, including runtime detection limits (`X-Query-Tags` + `User-Agent`) and release-family watchlists for forward support planning.

## [1.0.20] - 2026-04-14

### Features

- add `zstd`-capable read-path compression support for client responses and peer-cache transfers, plus negotiated upstream `zstd`/`gzip` decoding for backend responses when the upstream provides compressed payloads

## [1.0.19] - 2026-04-14

### Bug Fixes

- patterns: normalize relative-range (`now`/`now-*`) cache key boundaries for `/loki/api/v1/patterns` so Drilldown refresh requests consistently reuse the correct time-scoped cache entries
- patterns: fill returned `samples` across the full requested range (`start..end` by `step`) with zero buckets for missing intervals, preventing short-tail-only pattern graphs after refresh
- patterns: parse relative (`now`/`now-*`) boundaries in extraction/fill paths and adaptively coarsen overly dense bucket grids, so large-scope high-volume pattern charts render full selected ranges instead of collapsing to recent minutes

## [1.0.18] - 2026-04-14

### Documentation

- add a Docusaurus-based GitHub Pages site with SEO landing pages for VictoriaLogs, Grafana Loki datasource usage, Explore, Drilldown, LogQL semantics, comparison, and migration flows
- polish the docs-site dark/light theme, switch navbar branding to the SVG logo, and refresh known differences / known issues pages against the current codebase
- align the repo docs with the current runtime flags and behavior, expand the source-backed comparison matrix, and add cost-model pages that use Loki's published throughput sizing plus VictoriaLogs compression caveats

### CI

- add a GitHub Pages workflow that builds and deploys the Docusaurus site from `website/`
- skip docs-site deployment cleanly until GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings, instead of failing `main` builds when the Pages site is not yet provisioned

## [1.0.15] - 2026-04-14

### Bug Fixes

- patterns: improve long-range `/loki/api/v1/patterns` extraction by windowing `query_range` sampling and merging samples across windows, so Drilldown pattern charts keep full-range visibility

## [1.0.14] - 2026-04-14

### Bug Fixes

- patterns: derive and forward a stable `step` for `/loki/api/v1/patterns` when clients omit it, preserving full selected time-range bucketization after Drilldown refresh

## [1.0.13] - 2026-04-14

### Bug Fixes

- patterns: honor `from`/`to` when `start`/`end` are not provided so Drilldown refresh requests keep the selected range scope
- patterns: replace fixed upstream source fetch limit (`1000`) with bounded adaptive sampling for longer ranges to prevent near-now-only pattern results after refresh

## [1.0.12] - 2026-04-14

### Features

- patterns: support static custom pattern overlays via inline JSON/text (`-patterns-custom`) and file-backed input (`-patterns-custom-file`) for deterministic Drilldown pattern suggestions
- patterns: prefer `query_range` during pattern extraction with `query` fallback so Drilldown pattern graphs align with selected time windows instead of only recent tail data

### Chart

- add Helm wiring for custom patterns via `patternsCustom.inline` and `patternsCustom.file.*` (including optional ConfigMap generation and mount wiring)

### Tests

- extend proxy unit coverage for custom pattern parsing, file loading, and merged `/patterns` response behavior

## [1.0.11] - 2026-04-14

### Features

- runtime compatibility: add Loki-compatible `/config/tenant/v1/limits` endpoint to expose published tenant limits for datasource/runtime probing
- runtime compatibility: wire `/loki/api/v1/drilldown-limits` to runtime published limits (including per-tenant overrides) instead of fixed literals

### Configuration

- add published limits runtime controls: `tenant-limits-allow-publish`, `tenant-default-limits`, and `tenant-limits`
- add matching environment variables: `TENANT_LIMITS_ALLOW_PUBLISH`, `TENANT_DEFAULT_LIMITS`, and `TENANT_LIMITS`

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown-limits: advertise `pattern_ingester_enabled` from actual query-autodetect runtime state and `limits.pattern_persistence_enabled` from configured persistence path, so Grafana capability probing reflects real proxy behavior

### Tests

- contract: add unit/e2e regression coverage for `/config/tenant/v1/limits` and strict drilldown limits contract keys/types
- e2e compat: add Drilldown contract coverage for pattern flags and query-range-seeded autodetection through Grafana datasource resources
- e2e compat: add dedicated autodetect proxy verification (`localhost:3110`) asserting `patterns_detected_total` increases after `query_range`
- e2e UI: add Playwright Drilldown regression test proving `/resources/patterns` returns non-empty data for autodetect-enabled datasource
- e2e UI: stabilize Drilldown patterns autodetect test by seeding and validating against the guaranteed `api-gateway` stream in CI stacks

## [1.0.10] - 2026-04-14

### Documentation

- align release metadata and notes coverage for `1.0.8`/`1.0.9` so changelog and published GitHub releases remain consistent for patterns/persistence deliverables

### Bug Fixes

- patterns: canonicalize pattern cache keys across RFC3339 and Unix timestamp formats (and equivalent step formats) so Drilldown `/patterns` requests consistently reuse autodetected cache entries
- patterns: scope pattern detection queries to selector-only context for Drilldown-style pipelines, preventing empty responses when parser/filter stages are present
- patterns: treat empty on-disk pattern snapshot files as a startup no-op instead of surfacing JSON decode warnings

## [1.0.9] - 2026-04-14

### Features

- patterns: persist `/loki/api/v1/patterns` snapshots to disk and restore on startup for warm restarts
- patterns: support peer-warm startup flow so stale/missing local snapshots can be refreshed from fleet peers

### Configuration

- add patterns persistence/runtime flags: `patterns-persist-path`, `patterns-persist-interval`, `patterns-startup-stale-threshold`, `patterns-startup-peer-warm-timeout`
- wire and validate patterns autodetect/persistence flags end-to-end in startup/runtime config

### Reliability

- fail fast on invalid/unwritable patterns persistence paths with explicit startup validation errors

## [1.0.7] - 2026-04-13

### CI

- stabilize the label/field benchmark regression guard by raising only the catastrophic threshold for `BenchmarkProxy_LabelKeys_Scale_CacheBypass/keys_10000`, preventing flaky failures on shared GitHub runners while preserving strict bounds for other scale rows

## [1.0.6] - 2026-04-13

### Features

- patterns: add Loki-compatible `/loki/api/v1/patterns` extraction flow with canonicalized token clustering and low-signal line filtering for better parity on repeated dynamic log messages

### Configuration

- proxy: add `-patterns-enabled` runtime flag to explicitly enable/disable patterns API behavior
- chart: expose `extraArgs.patterns-enabled` in Helm values for straightforward deployment-time control

### Tests

- patterns: add benchmark scale coverage (`10/100/1000/10000`) with CI regression gates to keep cache-assisted patterns extraction from regressing in latency-sensitive paths

## [1.0.5] - 2026-04-13

### Observability

- rebuild the packaged operations dashboard resource section into a consistent operator view, adding directional CPU/memory/disk/network panels plus per-pod FD and RSS visibility
- add prefixed process disk operation metrics (`loki_vl_proxy_process_disk_read_operations_total`, `loki_vl_proxy_process_disk_write_operations_total`) for both Prometheus scrape and OTLP export

### Tests

- add a metric-name guard that fails CI when new unprefixed metric families are introduced outside the legacy compatibility allowlist

## [1.0.4] - 2026-04-13

### CI

- benchmarks: make label/field benchmark row parsing robust across GitHub runner output formats (single-line `Benchmark... ns/op ...`), preventing false CI failures when extracting the 12-row scale matrix

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-13

### Documentation

- unify operations dashboard artifacts by keeping a single `loki-vl-proxy` dashboard definition, removing the separate offenders dashboard variant from both top-level and Helm chart dashboard bundles

### Observability

- align proxy request telemetry with OTel semantic HTTP attributes, and add shared upstream/downstream route-aware request dimensions for Loki and VictoriaLogs visibility

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown: resolve `service_name` detected-field values via the dedicated service discovery fast path before generic field scans, removing intermittent `No data` responses in field value search
- drilldown: make detected-label value fallback alias-aware so underscore keys (for example `k8s_cluster_name`) correctly resolve dotted VL labels

### Performance

- cache: increase discovery endpoint TTLs for labels and detected fields/values/labels to reduce repeated upstream metadata scans during drilldown exploration

### CI

- benchmarks: add always-on label/field scale benchmark matrix (`10/100/1000/10000`) with artifact upload, workflow summary table, and a conservative ns/op regression guard

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-13

### Bug Fixes

- chart: decouple StatefulSet immutable `spec.serviceName` from peer-discovery alias settings by binding StatefulSet identity to `workload.statefulSet.serviceName` and rendering an additional DNS headless alias service when `peerCache.serviceName` differs

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-13

### Bug Fixes

- drilldown: fix `service_name` label values intermittently returning empty by preserving detected-label summaries and using selector-only context for service discovery fallbacks
- drilldown: treat non-2xx discovery responses as errors (instead of silent empty success) for fields/labels/value discovery paths to prevent false `no data`
- proxy: stop caching transient empty fallback payloads for detected fields/labels endpoints, reducing sticky post-error empty states until manual refresh

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-13

### CI

- make auto-release honor forward chart version overrides so published tags/images/charts can jump directly to `1.0.0` (and future explicit major/minor targets) instead of always patch-bumping from the latest tag

### Documentation

- update release and security policy docs for the `1.x` support line and release branch examples

## [0.27.43] - 2026-04-13

## [0.27.37] - 2026-04-12

### Reliability

- harden long-range query execution by adding `query_range` fallback from window-split execution to direct backend query path on transient upstream failures

- expand observability guidance with a row-by-row dashboard playbook for fast root-cause attribution

## [0.27.34] - 2026-04-11

### Configuration

- wire runtime support for indexed label-values cache flags end-to-end (`label-values-indexed-cache`, `label-values-hot-limit`, `label-values-index-max-entries`) to remove chart/runtime drift
- add persistent indexed label-values snapshot controls (`label-values-index-persist-path`, `label-values-index-persist-interval`, `label-values-index-startup-stale-threshold`, `label-values-index-startup-peer-warm-timeout`)

### Reliability

- restore indexed label-values cache state from disk on startup and persist periodic + graceful-shutdown snapshots for rolling updates

- gate readiness on indexed cache startup warm completion to keep probe behavior consistent during rollouts
- enable gzip compression for peer cache transport payloads on `_cache/get` to reduce transfer size/latency on large cache objects

### Tests

- add regression coverage for runtime flag wiring, indexed snapshot persistence/restore, stale-disk peer warm fallback, and peer gzip transport behavior
- pin e2e compose + manifest guards for indexed cache persistence flags so CI fails on drift

### Documentation

- document indexed cache persistence/warm behavior, sizing estimates, and chart/helm examples

## [0.27.33] - 2026-04-11

### Configuration

- expose indexed label-values browse cache knobs in Helm `extraArgs` (`label-values-indexed-cache`, `label-values-hot-limit`, `label-values-index-max-entries`) and document chart-based tuning examples for high-cardinality label UX

## [0.27.32] - 2026-04-11

### Bug Fixes

- add runtime learning for unique custom underscore-to-dotted field aliases from backend field inventory, with ambiguity safeguards and precedence for explicit mappings and known OTel aliases
- resolve `index/volume` and `index/volume_range` `targetLabels` aliases through stream-field inventory so underscore Loki labels (for example `host_id`) map to canonical dotted VL fields (`host.id`) without empty bucket regressions
- extend label alias resolution with configured `extra-label-fields` so custom dotted VL fields remain queryable via Loki-safe underscore aliases even when stream-field APIs are unavailable

### Documentation

- document Grafana Loki datasource builder caveats for dotted field keys and recommend underscore UI mode for stable click-to-filter workflows

## [0.27.31] - 2026-04-11

### Bug Fixes

- harden malformed dotted Drilldown pipeline stages (for example `| custom . \`pipeline.\``) to degrade into safe dotted-prefix regex filters instead of impossible field-existence matchers
- preserve Grafana datasource dotted-key filter intent by validating `key=value` label filtering for native dotted metadata fields (for example `k8s.cluster.name=my-cluster`) and preventing malformed dot-token fallback regressions
- normalize malformed spaced dotted triplets with trailing-dot artifacts (for example `custom . \`pipeline.processing.\` = \`vector-processing\``) into valid dotted field comparisons across translated query/query_range datasource operations

### CI

- expose compatibility component-level endpoint scores in PR quality reports and enforce shared component regressions through the quality gate

### Tests

- add unit, e2e-compat, and UI regression guards for dotted metadata key filtering across Explore/Drilldown query construction and datasource compatibility paths

## [0.27.29] - 2026-04-11

### Bug Fixes

- harden backend circuit-breaker accounting for long-range queries by counting only transport reachability failures as breaker failures, preventing transient upstream HTTP 5xx responses from opening the local breaker
- keep canceled/timeout upstream transport errors out of breaker failure accounting so client cancellations and timeout paths do not unnecessarily block subsequent traffic

### Tests

- add breaker regression coverage for upstream HTTP 502, transport connection failure, and canceled transport error paths
- add a 7-day query-range windowing regression test to verify adaptive parallel window fetch behavior under long time-range fanout

### CI

- enrich PR quality compatibility snapshots with component-level endpoint scores per track (Loki API, Logs Drilldown, VictoriaLogs) and render these as a dedicated report section for direct API-surface visibility
- harden the quality gate to validate required per-component compatibility signals and fail on shared component regressions or missing component breakdowns
- add CI unit coverage for quality-gate component checks and bump PR-quality base snapshot cache schema to refresh compatibility report shape

### CI

- remove an unused helper from stream metadata contract tests so `golangci-lint` `unused` checks pass reliably

## [0.27.26] - 2026-04-10

### Bug Fixes

- align categorized stream responses with upstream Loki/Grafana contract by emitting `data.encodingFlags=["categorize-labels"]` alongside 3-tuples and object-map metadata (`structuredMetadata`/`parsed`)

### Tests

- add categorized-stream contract coverage for metadata-disabled mode to enforce parser-safe 3-tuple output with empty metadata object
- add fuzz targets for metadata normalization and merged categorized-stream contract invariants

### CI

- add `fuzz-smoke` PR workflow steps to exercise structured-metadata normalization and merged categorized-stream contract fuzz targets

## [0.27.25] - 2026-04-10
### Bug Fixes

- normalize merged query stream metadata to Loki pair-tuples (`[[name,value], ...]`) so legacy/object-shaped metadata cannot trigger strict decoder `ReadArray` failures

### Tests

- extend tuple regression coverage for query-range and multitenant merge paths to lock pair-tuple metadata compatibility

## [0.27.24] - 2026-04-10

### Bug Fixes

- emit `structuredMetadata` and `parsed` tuple metadata as Loki pair-tuples (`[[name,value], ...]`) when `X-Loki-Response-Encoding-Flags: categorize-labels` is enabled, preventing strict decoder `ReadArray` failures on object-shaped or `{name,value}` pair payloads
- normalize multi-tenant merged stream metadata to pair-tuples (`[[name,value], ...]`) so legacy backend shapes cannot leak incompatible tuple payloads to strict decoders

### Tests

- harden tuple regression guards across single-tenant, multi-tenant merge, and query-range windowing paths to enforce Loki metadata pair-array shape and fail fast on future tuple payload regressions

## [0.27.23] - 2026-04-10

### Documentation

- add explicit compatibility profile guidance for chart operators, including recommended combinations of `label-style`, `metadata-field-mode`, and `emit-structured-metadata`
- link chart values comments directly to compatibility/configuration docs for faster profile selection during deployments

## [0.27.22] - 2026-04-10

### Bug Fixes

- segregate `query`/`query_range` cache keys by tuple mode (`default_2tuple` vs `categorize_labels_3tuple`) to prevent metadata 3-tuples from leaking into default Grafana decode paths

## [0.27.21] - 2026-04-10

### Bug Fixes

- migrate built-in system metric families from `node_*` to `process_*` so proxy-exported CPU/memory/disk/network/pressure signals are pod/container scoped instead of node-scoped by name
- harden `query_range` tuple-shape cache safety by keying cache entries with tuple mode (`default_2tuple` vs `categorize_labels_3tuple`) so metadata-enabled responses cannot leak into default Grafana decode paths (`ReadArray` regression guard)

### Features

- add Loki-aligned `query_range` window cache defaults (`split=1h`, `max-parallel=2`, `freshness=10m`, `recent-ttl=0s`, `history-ttl=24h`) with bounded parallel fanout and historical-window reuse
- add adaptive query-range window parallelism (`min/max` bounds with latency/error EWMA feedback) so backend fanout can scale up under healthy latency and back off under pressure
- add `-disk-cache-max-bytes` to cap on-disk L2 cache size for predictable retention and capacity control

### Observability

- add adaptive query-range tuning gauges: current parallelism, latency EWMA, and error EWMA, exposed in both Prometheus and OTLP metrics
- harden `Loki-VL-Proxy Metrics` dashboard selectors to tolerate headless/non-headless job+service labels and blank namespace URL vars so drilldown views no longer collapse to no-data
- add a `Query-Range Windowing` dashboard section (window fetch/merge latency, window cache hit ratio, adaptive EWMA/parallelism)
- update packaged dashboards, alerts, and runbook queries to consume `process_*` system metric families

### Tests

- add focused query-range helper coverage (`time parsing/normalization`, window split/ttl helpers, adaptive parallel controller behavior) to reduce CI quality-gate regressions
- add synthetic `/proc` OTLP system-metrics coverage to lock process-scope metric family compatibility

### Configuration

- enable `systemMetrics.hostProc.enabled` by default in the upstream chart and document the host `/proc` mount behavior for node-level CPU/memory/disk/network/PSI visibility

## [0.27.20] - 2026-04-10

### Tests

- expand tuple-contract coverage and smoke validation paths to keep strict default 2-tuple and categorize-labels 3-tuple behavior regression-safe
- add e2e compatibility checks for vlogs alerting plus recording-rule visibility across direct `vmalert`, proxy Prometheus endpoints, legacy Loki YAML, and Grafana datasource-proxy paths
- add dedicated e2e structured-metadata compatibility coverage for `-metadata-field-mode=hybrid` and `-metadata-field-mode=native`

### CI

- extend CI shard coverage to include structured-metadata compatibility tests so metadata mode regressions fail on pull requests
- harden tuple-smoke wiring to validate strict 2-tuples on the default proxy endpoint and `categorize-labels` 3-tuples on the metadata-enabled endpoint with explicit failure diagnostics

### Documentation

- update architecture/readme diagrams and migration/testing docs to describe recording-rule remote-write expectations and Grafana datasource-proxy `datasource_type=vlogs` validation flow
- document query-range window cache controls, Loki-aligned defaults, and practical disk sizing guidance for longer retention windows

## [0.27.19] - 2026-04-10

### Bug Fixes

- enforce strict Loki tuple behavior for query responses: default/no-flag requests return canonical 2-tuples, while `X-Loki-Response-Encoding-Flags: categorize-labels` returns Loki-style 3-tuples with `structuredMetadata` and/or `parsed`
- remove proxy-side Grafana caller sniffing and `structured_metadata` request overrides from tuple-shape decisions, so response shape is controlled only by Loki header flags
- remove non-Loki `structured_metadata` tuple key alias from query responses and keep only canonical Loki metadata keys

### Tests

- add strict `/query_range` and `/query` contract tests covering both default 2-tuple and `categorize-labels` 3-tuple paths
- add parser-chain/brace-heavy stream-response regression coverage to prevent `ReadArray` tuple-shape regressions in Grafana Explore/Drilldown
- extend `TestTupleContract_*` gate coverage to enforce both strict default 2-tuple and `categorize-labels` 3-tuple compliance paths
- add e2e parity checks for vlogs recording rules and alerts across direct `vmalert`, proxy Prometheus endpoints, legacy Loki YAML rules, and Grafana datasource proxy endpoints
- add e2e structured-metadata mode checks for `-metadata-field-mode=hybrid` vs `-metadata-field-mode=native` with OTel dotted fields and Loki-compatible underscore labels

### Documentation

- update API/config docs to describe strict `categorize-labels`-driven 3-tuple behavior and canonical Loki metadata keys
- update tuple-contract runbook guidance to the strict mode set (`default_2tuple`, `categorize_labels_3tuple`)
- document pinned e2e stack alerting/runtime updates, including recording-rule coverage and native-metadata profile checks
- refresh architecture and migration docs/mermaid flows to include optional recording-rule remote-write sinks and Grafana datasource-proxy `datasource_type=vlogs` validation paths

### CI

- add automated `tuple-smoke` workflow job that boots the compat stack, seeds logs, and runs `scripts/smoke-test.sh` (default + categorize-labels checks)
- add `TestStructuredMetadata_*` coverage to the `e2e-compat (otel-edge)` PR shard so hybrid/native metadata regressions fail on pull requests

### Observability

- align tuple-contract Prometheus alerts with strict mode labels (`default_2tuple`, `categorize_labels_3tuple`) and retire stale `grafana_*` mode assumptions

## [0.27.18] - 2026-04-10

### Bug Fixes

- restore Grafana-safe tuple defaults when `-emit-structured-metadata=true`: Explore/Drilldown requests now stay on canonical `[timestamp, line]` unless explicitly opted into `structured_metadata=true` (or `X-Loki-Response-Encoding-Flags: structured-metadata`), preventing `ReadArray` decode regressions
- harden Grafana metrics dashboard templating with universal regex-safe variables (`job`, `cluster`, `env`, `namespace`, `service`, `pod`) and default service scoping to reduce duplicated/noisy series

### Tests

- add strict tuple-shape regression coverage that decodes Grafana responses as `[2]string` tuples and fails on any metadata-object tuple shape leak
- add explicit tuple-contract tests for `/query_range`, `/query`, stream-response mode, multi-tenant merge, and parser-chain brace-heavy logs

### CI

- add a dedicated tuple-shape contract gate in CI (`TestTupleContract_*`) so Grafana default stream responses fail fast on any 3-tuple regression

### Observability

- add tuple-mode regression alerts for unexpected `grafana_default_3tuple` emissions and missing `grafana_default_2tuple` emissions while Grafana tuple traffic is present

### Documentation

- add `scripts/smoke-test.sh` deploy canary to validate strict 2-tuple Grafana responses on `/query_range` and `/query`
- add a dedicated Grafana tuple-contract runbook and include it in the alert runbook index

## [0.27.17] - 2026-04-10

### Bug Fixes

- default to Loki 3-tuple structured metadata for Grafana query callers when `-emit-structured-metadata=true`, so Explore one-event details include full metadata by default while still allowing explicit request override via `structured_metadata=true|false`

## [0.27.16] - 2026-04-10

### Bug Fixes

- normalize backtick-quoted LogQL line filters (for example ``|= `api` ``) to literal substring matches so parser pipelines such as `| logfmt` no longer drop valid lines
- make structured metadata emission default for Grafana query callers when `-emit-structured-metadata=true`, so Explore one-event details can include full metadata beyond stream labels; keep explicit request-level override support via `structured_metadata=true|false` and `X-Loki-Response-Encoding-Flags: structured-metadata`

### Tests

- add translator regression coverage for backtick raw-string line filters, including `|= ... | logfmt` and literals containing `|`
- add proxy coverage for Grafana default structured-metadata emission plus explicit `structured_metadata=false` opt-out behavior

## [0.27.15] - 2026-04-10

### Bug Fixes

- harden startup diagnostics and /proc-host mount guidance for system resource metrics so missing CPU/memory/disk/network/PSI families are surfaced explicitly at boot

### Tests

- add coverage for `PROC_ROOT` env override behavior and startup diagnostics branches (`passed`/`incomplete`) to prevent regressions in release quality checks

## [0.27.15] - 2026-04-10

### Bug Fixes

- keep Grafana Explore/Drilldown on canonical 2-tuples even when `-emit-structured-metadata=true`, and require explicit caller opt-in (`X-Loki-Response-Encoding-Flags: structured-metadata` or `structured_metadata=true`) for 3-tuples to prevent `ReadArray` client decode failures

### Observability

- add startup diagnostics for `/proc`-backed system metrics so missing CPU/memory/disk/network/PSI families are logged with concrete remediation instead of failing silently
- expand the main operations dashboard with system resource drilldown panels (memory, CPU modes, PSI pressure, disk/network throughput, process RSS, open FDs)
- add actionable system resource alerts for missing system metrics, high memory usage, and sustained CPU/IO PSI pressure

### Helm

- add chart support for host `/proc` mounting (`systemMetrics.hostProc.enabled`) and auto-wire `-proc-root` so node-level system metrics can be enabled explicitly in Kubernetes

### Documentation

- add a dedicated system-resources runbook and include it in the alert runbook index for faster incident handling

## [0.27.14] - 2026-04-10

### Bug Fixes

- preserve Loki stream 3-tuples (`[ts,line,metadata]`) in multi-tenant query merge paths so metadata-bearing responses no longer fail tuple decode/sort logic

### Observability

- align request-log attributes closer to OTEL semantic conventions by adding `url.path`, `network.peer.address`, `user.id`, `user.name`, and `event.duration` while keeping existing compatibility fields

## [0.27.13] - 2026-04-10

### Features

- add Service `trafficDistribution` support across chart service resources (`service` and `peerService`), including configurable values for `PreferSameZone`, `PreferSameNode`, and deprecated alias `PreferClose`

### Reliability

- add a StatefulSet immutable-field upgrade guard in the Helm chart to fail early when live immutable fields drift from desired values (`serviceName`, `podManagementPolicy`, `volumeClaimTemplates`)

## [0.27.12] - 2026-04-09

### Documentation

- add a Grafana user-header forwarding guide for Loki datasource deployments, including `dataproxy.send_user_header`, trusted proxy headers, and expected `enduser.id` / `auth.*` request-log behavior

## [0.27.11] - 2026-04-09

### Bug Fixes

- harden stream tuple metadata emission to always return a flat key/value object in tuple slot `2`, including requests with `X-Loki-Response-Encoding-Flags: categorize-labels`, so Explore/Drilldown clients that require array-safe tuple decoding do not fail on nested metadata objects
- classify upstream transport failures more accurately: map canceled upstream requests to `499` (`errorType=canceled`) and timeout/deadline failures to `504` (`errorType=timeout`) instead of generic `502`

## [0.27.11] - 2026-04-09

### Bug Fixes

- separate datasource/basic-auth credentials from end-user attribution: `enduser.id` now resolves from trusted user headers/tenant/client IP, while auth principals are reported separately via `auth.*` logs and `X-Loki-VL-Auth-*` upstream headers
- make emitted 3-tuple stream metadata parser-safe by default (flat key/value third element), and emit nested Loki categorized metadata (`structuredMetadata`/`parsed`) only when clients request `X-Loki-Response-Encoding-Flags: categorize-labels`
- enrich request logs with proxy context diagnostics, including cache result (`hit|miss|bypass`), upstream call count/status/latency, and proxy-overhead timing

## [0.27.10] - 2026-04-09

### Features

- add native VictoriaLogs operations dashboard with tenant/client/cluster/env filtering for incident analysis independent of Loki-proxy query health
- expand packaged PrometheusRule coverage with backend-latency and client bad-request burst alerts linked to dedicated runbooks

### Bug Fixes

- dedupe translated metric `by(...)` labels after alias mapping so queries that combine canonical and alias fields (for example `level` plus `detected_level`) do not emit duplicate stats grouping columns
- add opt-in `-emit-structured-metadata` support for Loki-style stream 3-tuples `[timestamp, line, metadata]` while keeping default query responses on canonical 2-tuples for compatibility
- expose `structured_metadata` as a compatibility alias alongside canonical `structuredMetadata` in emitted stream metadata payloads

### Documentation

- split runbooks into per-alert files under `docs/runbooks/` and add deployment/scaling best-practice guidance for prevention-focused operations
- document dashboard purpose mapping in README/operations/observability and move release-process details to `docs/release-info.md`

### CI

- enforce canonical dashboard/alert asset sync in CI and support syncing multiple dashboard JSON files into chart assets
- add auto-release tag push fallback to retry with the workflow token when checkout credentials cannot create tags
- make auto-release tag creation prefer `RELEASE_PR_TOKEN` when configured and fall back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` only if needed
- avoid failing auto-release when metadata sync branch push is denied; emit warnings and skip metadata PR automation for that run

## [0.27.8] - 2026-04-08

### CI

- stabilize PR performance smoke by running benchmarks/load in an isolated phase after functional checks, increasing benchmark sample depth (`-benchtime=2s`, `-count=7`), and tightening perf regression thresholds to better flag real cache-bypass regressions
- harden release publishing for org moves by normalizing GHCR owner names to lowercase and keeping metadata-sync invocation compatible with tagged release script versions
- add fallback manual-release notes when a tag lacks a versioned changelog section, so republish runs can still proceed

### Features

- make chart `goMemLimitPercent` effective at runtime by computing and injecting `GOMEMLIMIT` from `resources.limits.memory` when `goMemLimit` is not explicitly set
- expand the packaged PrometheusRule set with backend-latency and client-bad-request alerts, and point each alert to dedicated per-alert runbook files
- add a native VictoriaLogs operations dashboard focused on tenant/client/cluster/env filtering to keep operator visibility when Loki/proxy query paths are degraded

### Documentation

- update values and performance docs with explicit `goMemLimitPercent` behavior, precedence, supported units, and runtime output format
- reorganize README LogQL compatibility into native-VictoriaLogs vs proxy-compatibility sections with direct VictoriaLogs references, expand documentation index links, and clarify read-only rules/alerts boundaries with `vmalert` and VictoriaLogs docs
- split runbooks into `docs/runbooks/` per-alert files, add deployment/scaling best-practice guidance, and document dashboard roles in README/operations/observability

### CI

- make observability asset sync/check support multiple dashboard JSON files under `dashboard/*.json` and chart copies under `charts/loki-vl-proxy/dashboards/*.json`

## [0.27.7] - 2026-04-08

### Features

- add safe Tier0 compatibility-cache controls and route-level guardrails for cacheable Loki read endpoints

### Performance

- expand cache benchmark coverage for query and Drilldown metadata paths, including delayed-backend hit-path comparisons and fleet peer-cache warm-hit behavior

### Tests

- extend proxy, middleware, cache, metrics, and e2e fleet/ui coverage to harden cache behavior, race-prone paths, and runtime regressions

### CI

- enforce Helm chart `version` and `appVersion` validation after release metadata sync in both auto and manual release workflows, and publish Docker Hub images to the canonical `docker.io/reliablyobserve/loki-vl-proxy` repository when credentials are configured

### Documentation

- refresh README, architecture, and performance guidance with clearer operator-facing cache topology, Tier0 mapping, and value-focused messaging
- update repository links, chart metadata references, image examples, and testing/compatibility doc links to the `ReliablyObserve/Loki-VL-proxy` org namespace and current docs structure

## [0.27.6] - 2026-04-07

### CI

- require `100%` Loki compatibility on PR quality and dedicated Loki compatibility workflow checks
- allow release metadata sync PRs to pass changelog gating when they materialize `Unreleased` into a versioned section
- support `RELEASE_PR_TOKEN` in release workflows so metadata PRs trigger required pull_request checks under branch protection
- skip PR quality performance smoke on non-perf-sensitive changes to avoid runner-jitter noise in docs/metadata/CI-only PR reports

## [0.27.5] - 2026-04-07

### CI

- route release metadata sync through a dedicated PR branch with auto-merge instead of direct pushes to `main`, and keep GitHub release notes sourced from changelog section content only

## [0.27.4] - 2026-04-07

### Features

- add ingress-backed and native-only `/tail` compatibility coverage for Grafana Explore and compose e2e
- extend multi-tenant Explore and Logs Drilldown coverage for `__tenant_id__`, label breakdowns, and service drilldowns
- prefer native VictoriaLogs field names, field values, and streams metadata for Drilldown discovery, with bounded fallback scanning for parsed and derived fields
- harden Loki label and Drilldown metadata resolution so stream metadata is preferred, exact native names win, and ambiguous translated aliases avoid silent wrong-field fallback
- complete the upstream Helm distribution surface with deployable runtime templates, peer-cache DNS service wiring, optional Gateway API routing, and OCI chart publication from release workflows
- add chart-native StatefulSet support, PVC-backed disk-cache defaults, and extra claim templates for persistent cache deployments

### Performance

- harden proxy cache and fanout hot paths with tighter response capture, typed multi-tenant merges, translation caching, capped pattern extraction, and safer synthetic-tail state bounds
- enforce bounded allocation on pattern responses and keep expensive metadata paths warm without stretching live query and tail freshness

### CI

- make the PR labeler fail-soft when optional repository labels are missing
- split Grafana UI smoke coverage into stable shards, add PR-time current-family and previous-family Grafana smoke plus scheduled/manual runtime profiles, and move browser-independent Grafana checks into cheaper non-browser gates
- prebuild and cache proxy images in Docker-backed CI jobs, run compose stacks with `--no-build`, and keep grouped compatibility gates with a legacy `e2e-compat` aggregate shim for required-check compatibility
- fix release workflow parsing by using env-based Docker Hub secret gating in `auto-release` and `release` workflows

### Tests

- add `/tail` ingress, idle-window, and native-failure regressions against the live compose stack
- expand tail fallback coverage so auto mode is verified against upstream `401`, `403`, and `5xx` native-tail failures without reopening browser cost
- add browser-level Explore live-tail and multi-tenant Logs Drilldown regressions
- raise `cmd/proxy` startup/server-loop coverage with more direct unit tests
- add HTTP-level Explore compatibility contracts, Drilldown filtered/freshness/empty-success resource contracts, explicit oversized multi-tenant fanout coverage, and stronger native tail failure propagation coverage
- extract pure Grafana Explore/Drilldown URL builders, test them directly, and add browser console/request guardrails plus reload-persistence smoke coverage
- make Logs Drilldown `1.x` and `2.x` contract assertions explicit in the source matrix, and harden Playwright smokes against toolbar overflow and in-place URL state updates
- add explicit Grafana runtime-family assertions so `11.x` keeps the `1.x` Drilldown expectations and `12.x` keeps the `2.x` expectations
- add resolver and handler coverage for stream-metadata preference, native-name precedence, and alias-collision behavior in label and Drilldown paths

### Documentation

- document native-first Drilldown discovery, multi-tenant safety caps, metadata-vs-live cache freshness, and tail mode behavior across README and operator docs
- document the Playwright shard matrix, browser-vs-non-browser coverage split, and the pinned/current/previous Grafana runtime compatibility profiles

## [0.27.0] - 2026-04-06

### Features

- configurable `tail.mode` with explicit `auto`, `native`, and `synthetic` streaming modes for Loki-compatible `/tail`

### CI

- require releasable PRs to update `CHANGELOG.md` `Unreleased` via a dedicated changelog gate workflow

### Tests

- compose-backed `/tail` coverage now verifies native live frames, forced synthetic tail streaming, and browser-origin behavior against the real stack
- Grafana Explore UI coverage now includes a live-tail regression against the browser-allowed synthetic-tail datasource

## [0.26.1] - 2026-04-06

### Features

- observability guide with metrics catalog, JSON log schema, and collector/agent integration examples
- OTLP metrics export now carries the same core proxy metric names as `/metrics`
- OTel-friendly JSON logging is now used consistently across proxy, disk cache, cache warmer, and OTLP export paths

### Tests

- expanded OTLP exporter and observability configuration coverage

## [0.26.0] - 2026-04-05

### Features

- improve observability and pr quality reporting

### Bug Fixes

- validate release prs via workflow dispatch (#5)
- align release notes with changelog (#3)
- restore nonzero pr quality snapshots
- keep pr quality metrics json clean
- publish releases from workflow dispatch
- restore release workflow automation

### Tests

- 1023 total tests (86.3% coverage)

## [0.25.0] - 2026-04-05

### Features

- improve hybrid drilldown compatibility
- expand drilldown and compatibility coverage
- improve tenant defaults and observability
- **Single-tenant VictoriaLogs migration mode**: `X-Scope-OrgID: "0"` and `X-Scope-OrgID: "*"` now use VictoriaLogs' default tenant (`AccountID=0`, `ProjectID=0`) when no tenant map is configured. This keeps Grafana Loki datasources simple for single-tenant backends while preserving strict mapped multitenancy.
- **Optional global bypass in mapped mode**: New `-tenant.allow-global` flag allows `0` and `*` to keep using the backend default tenant even when a tenant map is configured, making staged migrations from Loki string tenants to VictoriaLogs numeric tenants easier.
- **Client identity propagation**: The proxy now derives client identity from trusted Grafana headers, tenant, basic auth, or remote address and forwards `X-Loki-VL-Client-ID` and `X-Loki-VL-Client-Source` to the backend. When `-metrics.trust-proxy-headers=true`, `X-Grafana-User` is also forwarded.
- **Client-centric observability**: `/metrics` now exports per-client request counters, per-client status breakdowns, in-flight request gauges, response bytes, and LogQL query length histograms to identify the real users driving load.
- **Fleet peer-cache observability**: Added peer-cache metrics for remote peers, total ring members, peer hits, misses, and errors so fleet behavior can be diagnosed without relying only on logs.

### Bug Fixes

- stabilize compatibility and release automation
- repair auto release workflow
- backfill changelog and release tagging

### Security

- **Fail-closed multitenancy preserved**: Unknown non-numeric tenant strings still return `403 Forbidden` instead of silently falling back to the global VictoriaLogs tenant.
- **Global tenant bypass is explicit**: In mapped deployments, `0` and `*` only bypass tenant scoping when `-tenant.allow-global=true`.
- **Trusted-header handling tightened**: Grafana user identity is only used for metrics and backend context forwarding when `-metrics.trust-proxy-headers=true`.

### Operations

- **Pinned build and CI toolchain versions**: Workflows now use Go `1.26.1`, `golangci-lint` `v2.11.4`, Docker builder image `golang:1.26.1-alpine3.22`, and runtime image `alpine:3.22.2`.
- **Updated local/dev runtime images**: The dev/test Compose stack now uses `victoriametrics/victoria-logs:v1.49.0`.
- **Release workflow improvements**: Release builds now package the Helm chart as a versioned `.tgz` asset, update chart metadata during auto-release PR creation, and stop publishing a floating Docker `latest` tag.

### Documentation

- Added the full request-flow diagram to the top-level README.
- Updated configuration, API reference, fleet cache, and scaling docs for tenant defaults, client metrics, fleet metrics, pinned versions, and Grafana datasource behavior.

### Tests

- 974 total tests (82.9% coverage)

- mark e2e-compat as continue-on-error (data ingestion timing flakes)
- remove unused functions, fix staticcheck SA9003/QF1001
- lint errcheck exclusions, staticcheck fix, e2e docker compose startup
- move errcheck test exclusion to linters.exclusions.rules (golangci-lint v2)
- simplify golangci-lint v2 config, add Apache 2.0 license
- race detector fix, golangci-lint v2 config, fuzz tests, README badges

### Tests

- 920 total tests (82.2% coverage)

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-04

### Features

- **Proxy-side subquery evaluation**: `max_over_time(rate({app="nginx"}[5m])[1h:5m])` no longer returns an error. The proxy parses the subquery syntax, executes the inner metric query at each sub-step interval (e.g., every 5m over 1h = 12 VL queries), and aggregates results with the outer function (max, min, avg, sum, count, stddev, stdvar, first, last). Concurrent sub-step execution (bounded at 10) keeps latency low. Both query_range and instant query endpoints are supported.
- **VL stream selector optimization** (`-stream-fields`): New `-stream-fields=app,env,namespace` flag tells the proxy which labels are VL `_stream_fields`. For those labels, the proxy uses VL's native `{label="value"}` stream selectors (fast index path) instead of field filters. Non-stream-field labels still use field filters for correctness. Mixed matchers split correctly.
- **Loki-compatible error responses**: Error responses now use Loki/Prometheus-standard `errorType` values (`bad_data`, `execution`, `unavailable`, `timeout`, `canceled`, `internal`, `too_many_requests`) instead of a generic `bad_request` for all errors.

### Performance

Subquery benchmarks (Apple M3 Max):

| Subquery | Latency | Allocs | Memory |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| 3 steps (30m/10m) | 270µs | 1,152 | 170KB |
| 12 steps (1h/5m) | 634µs | 2,545 | 360KB |
| 72 steps (6h/5m) | 2.4ms | 11,693 | 1.1MB |
| 288 steps (24h/5m) | 8.6ms | 44,667 | 3.9MB |

Load: 7,036 subquery req/s at 50 concurrent (4 VL calls each). Stable memory (~47-48 MB per 100-request round, no leak).

### Tests

- 666 total tests (80 new: subquery parsing/evaluation/aggregation/perf/regression, stream selector optimization, Loki error format, duration/timestamp parsing)

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-04

### Bug Fixes

- **CI: go vet failure** — fixed atomic.Int64 copy in perf_test.go
- **CI: golangci-lint errors** — added .golangci.yml config (errcheck excluded in tests, common HTTP patterns excluded)
- **CI: release workflow** — `release` job no longer blocked by `compat-check` failure; uses `if: always() && needs.test.result == 'success'`
- **CI: system metrics test** — robust on idle CI runners (CPU delta may be 0)
- **errcheck in production code** — `conn.Close()`, `conn.WriteMessage()`, `resp.Body.Close()` properly handled

### Security

- **CodeQL analysis** — added `.github/workflows/codeql.yaml` for weekly security scanning

### GitHub Releases

- Created missing releases v0.17.0 through v0.21.0 on GitHub (were git tags only)

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-04

### Features

- **LRU cache eviction**: Evicts least-recently-used entries instead of random map iteration. O(1) promote on access, O(1) evict from tail. Hot entries survive under cache pressure.
- **`unwrap duration()/bytes()` unit conversion**: Proxy-side parsers for Loki duration strings (ns/us/ms/s/m/h/d) to seconds and byte strings (B/KB/KiB/MB/MiB/GB/GiB/TB/TiB) to bytes.
- **System metrics from /proc** (Linux): CPU (user/system/iowait), memory (total/available/free/usage ratio), process RSS/FDs, disk IO, network IO, PSI pressure stall (cpu/memory/io at 10s/60s/300s).
- **`bool` modifier on comparisons**: Stripped at translation; applyOp returns 1/0 for all comparisons.
- **Field-specific parser**: `| json f1, f2` / `| logfmt f1, f2` maps to full unpack.
- **Backslash quote handling**: `findMatchingBrace` handles `\"` in stream selectors.

### Tests

- 583 total tests (31 new: 4 LRU, 26 unit conversion, 1 translator)

## [0.20.0] - 2026-04-04

### Features

- System metrics (/proc CPU, mem, IO, net, PSI), @ modifier, remaining gap tests

## [0.19.0] - 2026-04-04

### Performance

- **Buffer pool for JSON encoding**: `marshalJSON()` uses `sync.Pool`-backed `bytes.Buffer` (64KB cap) for all JSON response encoding, reducing allocations across all handlers
- **Pooled response body reads**: `readBodyPooled()` reuses buffers for `io.ReadAll` paths
- **GOGC=200**: Helm chart sets `GOGC=200` (halves GC frequency for proxy workloads with short-lived allocations)
- **sync.Pool for NDJSON**: Entry maps pooled and reused across log line parsing (49% less memory)
- **Connection pool tuning**: `MaxIdleConnsPerHost=256` (was Go default 2), prevents port exhaustion at high concurrency
- **Results**: 39K req/s at 200 concurrent (no-cache), up from 8K before optimizations (+388% total improvement)

### Features

- **Complete Helm chart**: 11 templates — deployment, service, HPA, PDB, ServiceMonitor, ingress, HTTPRoute (Gateway API), NetworkPolicy, PVC, headless service for peer cache
- **GOMEMLIMIT auto-calc**: Calculates GOMEMLIMIT as configurable % of `resources.limits.memory` (default 70%)
- **Go runtime metrics**: `/metrics` exposes `go_memstats_alloc_bytes`, `go_memstats_sys_bytes`, `go_goroutines`, `go_gc_cycles_total`
- **Peer cache design**: Architecture doc for distributed L1.5 cache across replicas via headless service + consistent hashing

### Security

- **Rate limit bypass fixed**: `ClientID()` uses `RemoteAddr` (not spoofable `X-Forwarded-For`)
- **SECURITY.md**: Vulnerability reporting policy, security features documented
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Development workflow, code style, areas for contribution
- **Issue templates**: Bug report and feature request templates

### Tests

- 529 total tests (30 new coverage gap tests covering admin stubs, fallback paths, VL error propagation, label round-trips, Unicode, metrics recording)
- Performance regression tests: connection pool, memory leak detection, buffer pool safety
- CI benchmark job with artifact upload and regression gate

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-04

### Security Fixes

- **P0: Cross-tenant data exposure in 7 handlers**: `handleSeries`, `handleIndexStats`, `handleVolume`, `handleVolumeRange`, `handleDetectedFields`, `handleDetectedFieldValues`, `handlePatterns` were missing `withOrgID(r)` — tenant headers never forwarded to VL
- **P0: Cross-tenant cache leak**: Cache keys for `/labels` and `/label/values` did not include `X-Scope-OrgID` — Tenant A's cached response could be served to Tenant B
- **P0: Rate limit bypass via X-Forwarded-For**: `ClientID()` trusted raw attacker-controlled `X-Forwarded-For` header. Now uses `RemoteAddr` (connection-level, not spoofable) with port stripping for consistent bucketing

### Bug Fixes

- **P1: `handleReady` nil dereference**: When VL is unreachable (`err != nil`), `resp` is nil but `resp.StatusCode` was accessed — panic in production. Now checks `err` first, defers `resp.Body.Close()`
- **P1: `ForwardHeaders` dead code**: Config field stored but never used in `applyBackendHeaders`. Now threads original request via context and copies configured headers to VL requests
- **P2: `handleSeries` swallows VL errors**: Always returned 200 with empty data on backend errors. Now propagates VL error status codes
- **P2: Goroutine leak in `cleanupStaleClients`**: No shutdown mechanism — leaked on config reload. Added `Stop()` method with `done` channel
- **P2: `containsWithoutClause` false positive on escaped quotes**: `\"` inside strings incorrectly toggled quote state. Now handles backslash escapes

### Tests

- 9 new tenant scoping tests (7 handler tests + 2 cache isolation tests)
- Updated `ClientID` tests for security change (XFF ignored, port stripped)
- 471 total tests passing

## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-04

### Security Fixes

- **P0: Tenant map reload data race**: `forwardTenantHeaders` now holds `configMu.RLock` when reading `tenantMap`, preventing data race on SIGHUP reload
- **P0: `without()` clause silent wrong behavior**: `without()` was silently treated as `by()` producing incorrect aggregation results. Now returns a clear error directing users to use `by()` with explicit labels

### Bug Fixes

- **Binary operators**: `applyOp` now handles `%` (modulo), `^` (power), and comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) — previously these silently returned the left operand
- **CB metrics mismatch**: Circuit breaker `State()` returns `"half_open"` but metrics matched `"half-open"` — half-open gauge never showed value 2. Now accepts both forms
- **`targetLabels` on volume_range**: `handleVolumeRange` now forwards the `targetLabels` param as VL `field` (was missing, only `/volume` had it)
- **`IsScalar` negative/scientific**: `IsScalar` now uses `strconv.ParseFloat` — supports `-1`, `1e5`, `1.5e-3` (previously only digits and dots)

### Features

- **Delete API endpoint**: `/loki/api/v1/delete` added as exception to read-only proxy with 7 safeguards: POST-only, `X-Delete-Confirmation` header, non-wildcard query, time range required, 30-day max range, tenant scoping, audit logging at WARN level

### Documentation

- **Restructured docs**: README slimmed to project summary + architecture, content moved to categorized files:
  - `docs/architecture.md` — component design, data flow, protection layers
  - `docs/configuration.md` — all flags, env vars, cache, tenancy, TLS, OTLP
  - `docs/api-reference.md` — endpoint table, delete safeguards, metrics
  - `docs/translation-reference.md` — LogQL to LogsQL mapping, supported/unsupported
  - `docs/testing.md` — test categories, running tests, fuzz testing
- **Updated KNOWN_ISSUES.md** with v0.17.0 fixes

### Tests

- 50+ new tests: concurrent tenant reload (race detector), all binary operators (18 cases), delete safeguards (8 cases), CB metrics, `IsScalar`, `without()` clause detection

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-04

### Security Fixes

- **P0: Coalescer tenant data leak**: `RequestKey()` now includes `X-Scope-OrgID` in the hash, preventing cross-tenant response sharing via singleflight coalescing
- **P0: isStatsQuery false-positive**: Rewrote stats detection to skip quoted regions — `|= "stats query"` no longer triggers stats handler routing
- **P0: Metrics always recording 200**: `handleQueryRange` and `handleQuery` now capture actual HTTP status codes via `statusCapture` wrapper. VL error responses (4xx/5xx) are propagated to clients.

### Features

- **Direction parameter**: `proxyLogQuery` reads Loki's `direction` param and appends VL's `| sort by (_time)` or `| sort by (_time desc)` accordingly
- **Labels query param**: `/labels` endpoint now translates and forwards the `query` param to scope label suggestions in Grafana Explore
- **`without()` grouping**: `extractOuterAggregation` now accepts `without()` alongside `by()` in outer aggregation clauses
- **Additional outer aggregations**: `stddev`, `stdvar`, `sort`, `sort_desc` added to the aggregation regex
- **`label_format` multi-rename**: `| label_format a="{{.x}}", b="{{.y}}"` now generates separate `| format` pipes for each assignment
- **`quantile_over_time`**: Maps to VL's `quantile(phi, field)` stats function
- **`absent_over_time`**: Maps to VL's `count()`
- **Stats response label translation**: Dotted VL label names in metric responses are now translated to underscore format
- **VL error message mapping**: `wrapAsLokiResponse` detects VL error formats and translates to Loki's `{"status":"error","error":"..."}` format
- **Admin endpoint stubs**: `/loki/api/v1/rules`, `/loki/api/v1/alerts`, `/config` for Grafana Alerting ruler mode compatibility
- **Half-open circuit breaker fix**: Half-open state now limits probe requests to `successThreshold` count instead of allowing all
- **`convertGoTemplate` dotted fields**: `{{.service.name}}` now correctly maps to `<service.name>`
- **`unwrap` conversion wrappers**: `| unwrap duration(field)` and `| unwrap bytes(field)` now strip the wrapper and extract the field name
- **Extended binary operators**: `%`, `^`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` added to binary metric expression parsing

- 8 new e2e compat tests for direction, labels query param, quantile_over_time, tenant isolation, error propagation, without() grouping, label_format multi-rename

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-04

### Features

- **`/loki/api/v1/patterns` — real implementation**: Proxy-side drain-like pattern extraction. Queries VL for log lines, tokenizes to patterns (replaces IPs, numbers, UUIDs, timestamps with `<_>`), groups by pattern, returns sorted by frequency. Handles both structured (JSON) and unstructured log formats.

### Tests

- 349 unit tests, 80+ e2e tests
- Pattern extraction unit tests (tokenize, isVariable, extractLogPatterns)
- E2e: patterns endpoint with real data, Loki vs proxy comparison

- **263 unit tests, 50+ e2e tests** — all passing

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-03

### Features

- **Loki-VL-proxy**: HTTP proxy translating Loki API to VictoriaLogs
- **LogQL to LogsQL translator**: stream selectors, line filters (substring semantics),
  parsers (json, logfmt, pattern, regexp), label filters, metric queries (rate,
  count_over_time, bytes_over_time, sum by, topk), unwrap handling
- **Response converter**: VL NDJSON → Loki streams format, VL stats → Prometheus matrix/vector
- **Request coalescing**: singleflight deduplication — N identical concurrent queries → 1 backend request
- **Rate limiting**: per-client token bucket + global concurrent query semaphore
- **Circuit breaker**: opens after consecutive failures, auto-recovers via half-open probing
- **Query normalization**: sort label matchers, collapse whitespace for better cache hits
- **TTL cache**: per-endpoint TTLs (labels=60s, queries=10s), max 256MB, eviction tracking
- **Prometheus metrics**: `/metrics` endpoint with request counters, latency histograms, cache stats
- **JSON structured logs**: via Go's slog to stdout
- **Helm chart**: VictoriaMetrics-style with extraArgs, ServiceMonitor, security context
- **GHA CI/CD**: build, test, lint, Docker multi-arch, GitHub Release with binaries + checksums
- **Docker**: single static binary, ~10MB Alpine-based image

### Critical Fixes

- **Substring vs word matching**: Loki `|= "text"` is substring match; translated to VL `~"text"`
  (not `"text"` which is word-only). Without this fix, queries silently return fewer results.
- **Stream filter vs field filter**: Loki stream selectors `{level="error"}` converted to VL
  field filters `level:=error` (not stream filters which only match `_stream_fields`)
- **Parser + filter chains**: `| json | status >= 400` correctly becomes
  `| unpack_json | filter status:>=400` in VL
- **Regex quoting**: `namespace=~"prod|staging"` properly quoted as `namespace:~"prod|staging"`
- **Keep fields**: `| keep app, level` always includes `_time, _msg, _stream` for response building

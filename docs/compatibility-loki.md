# Loki Compatibility

This track measures how closely the proxy behaves like Loki on Loki-facing APIs and LogQL behavior.

## Scope

- `/labels`, `/label/<name>/values`, `/series`, `/query`, `/query_range`
- LogQL parser, filter, metric, and OTel label compatibility
- Synthetic compatibility labels the proxy must expose to Loki clients, such as `service_name`
- Manifest-driven query semantics parity against real Loki in [query-semantics-matrix.json](../test/e2e-compat/query-semantics-matrix.json)
- Tracked operation inventory in [query-semantics-operations.json](../test/e2e-compat/query-semantics-operations.json)

## CI And Score

- Workflow: `compat-loki.yaml`
- Score test: `TestLokiTrackScore`
- Required PR gate: `loki-pinned`, which runs the `TestQuerySemantics*` inventory + matrix suite
- Runtime matrix: real Loki images
- Support window: current Loki minor family plus one minor family behind

The Loki matrix is a moving window. When a new Loki minor becomes current, the matrix advances to that family and the immediately previous minor family. Older minors drop out of support.

## Proxy Behavior Parity — Release Notes

### v1.16.0 — LogQL Syntax Validation

The proxy now validates LogQL before attempting translation and returns HTTP 400 with a plain-text `parse error` body matching Loki's exact error format. Before this release, invalid queries returned HTTP 200 or an opaque proxy error instead.

Shapes that now return HTTP 400:

| Shape | Example |
|---|---|
| Binary operation on log/pipeline expressions | `{app="x"} == {app="y"}`, `count_over_time({app="x"}[5m]) + {app="y"}` |
| Malformed stream selector | `{app=}`, unclosed `{app="x"` |
| Empty query or missing stream selector | bare `| json` with no stream-selector prefix |

The `-patterns-enabled` flag defaults to `true` and controls whether pattern-match line filters (`|>` / `!>`) are accepted.

### v1.17.0 — detected_fields Type Inference

Logfmt fields now report `type=int` or `type=float` for numeric values instead of always reporting `type=string`. For example, `status=400` is inferred as `int` and `latency_ms=300` as `int`. This matters because Grafana's Drilldown plugin filters unwrap field candidates by `type=int` or `type=float`; logfmt numeric fields were invisible in the unwrap dropdown before this fix.

### v1.17.0 — Bare `| unwrap` Silent Drop

A bare `| unwrap` with no field name (emitted by the Grafana query builder while a user is actively selecting a field) is now silently stripped from the pipeline instead of producing a VictoriaLogs parse error. This is an intermediate query state that Loki itself handles gracefully.

### v1.17.1 — Metric Label Pollution Fix

When `detected_level` is synthesized from the `level` label in metric aggregation results (for example `sum by (detected_level)`), the raw `level` label is now removed from the result series. Before this fix `sum by (detected_level)` returned a series with both `detected_level` and `level` set to `"error"`; after it returns only `detected_level="error"`, matching Loki's output.

### v1.17.1 — Nested JSON Objects Excluded From detected_fields

Nested JSON objects (for example a field whose value is itself a JSON object such as `service.name = "api-gateway"` encoded as an object) are now skipped during the detected_fields body scan. Before this fix these appeared as filterable fields with a raw JSON string as their value, which broke the Grafana Drilldown field breakdown panel.

### v1.20.0 — detected_level Inference and Bare Label Matchers

`detected_level` is now synthesised from JSON/logfmt `level`, `severity`, and `lvl` field variants, matching Loki's level inference rules. Bare label matchers (e.g. `{app="api"}` without a filter pipeline) now preserve the stream label set exactly as Loki does.

### v1.21.x — label_replace, label_join, group, count_values, Stream Ordering

`label_replace()` and `label_join()` metric transformations, the `group()` aggregation, and `count_values()` now produce output that matches Loki's label semantics. Stream result ordering for log queries is aligned with Loki's timestamp-descending default.

`count_values()` returns HTTP 400 with message: *"count_values is not translatable to LogsQL"*

### v1.29.x — __error__ Opt-In and Cold Storage Routing

The `__error__` / `| drop __error__` mechanism for opting parser-stage metric queries into the VL native stats fast path is now precisely gated: only queries where `| drop __error__` is the sole post-parser stage qualify, preventing false positives from queries that mention `__error__` in label values.

### v1.30.0 — detected_fields Hybrid OTel/Non-OTel

`service_name` alias now appears correctly in `detected_fields` for hybrid datasets that mix OTel `service.name` stream labels with pre-normalised `service_name` labels. The previous guard blocked the alias whenever any entry carried a literal `service_name` stream key.

### v1.31.0 — Bare Parser-Stage Metric Label Scoping

`rate(| json)` and similar bare parser-stage metrics no longer include parsed JSON field names (e.g. `path`, `method`, `status`) as metric series labels. Only stream labels appear in the output, matching Loki's behaviour where parsed fields become metric dimensions only when explicitly named in an outer `by (...)` aggregation.

### v1.31.2 — Parser-Stage Guard Removed From stats Fast Path

`rate`, `bytes_rate`, `count_over_time`, and `bytes_over_time` queries containing `| json` or `| logfmt` parser stages now use VL native `stats_query_range` for tumbling windows (`range == step`). These queries were previously forced onto the raw log-fetch slow path regardless of window type.

### v1.36.x — drop Matcher Semantics, Structured Metadata Classification

`| drop field=value` (matcher form) now correctly implements conditional semantics: VL `| delete` is issued for the field, and the proxy post-processes each log entry to restore the field value when it does not match the predicate. Previously the value predicate was ignored and the field was always removed.

`structuredMetadata` vs `parsedFields` classification in push/detected_fields paths is now correct: the proxy compares candidate field names against `_msg` JSON content to determine whether a field originates from structured metadata or was parsed from the log body.

The `-emit-structured-metadata` flag (default: `true`) controls whether log entries are returned as Loki 3-tuples `[timestamp, line, {metadata}]` or 2-tuples `[timestamp, line]`. Grafana Loki datasource requires 3-tuple format; only disable if your client cannot handle structured metadata.

Default `label-style` is now `underscores` and `metadata-field-mode` is now `translated`.

### v1.68.0 — Populated-Window Corrections

The exhaustive parity helper previously sent millisecond integers that Loki interprets as nanoseconds, so earlier pass counts did not compare populated data. The corrected results, fixes and remaining limits are recorded in [Real-window compatibility findings](real-window-compatibility-gaps.md); they do not establish full LogQL parity.

- Implicit many-to-one vector matching (several series matching one series without `group_left`/`group_right`) is rejected with HTTP 500 and Loki's `multiple matches for labels` error, checked independently at each timestamp.
- Invalid `ip()` line-filter arguments and operators other than `|=`/`!=` return parse errors.
- `unwrap duration(...)` and `unwrap bytes(...)` on the bare parser metric path convert unit strings such as `15ms` and `1024B`; previously every sample was dropped and no series was returned.
- Grouped `quantile_over_time` keeps its grouping, binary operators preserve precedence and `bool` semantics, and vector-vector operands are joined on a step-aligned grid.
- Scalar timestamps are encoded in seconds and sample values use Loki's fixed-point rendering.

## Edge Cases Covered

- JSON and logfmt parser chains followed by field filters
- `detected_level` grouped metric queries used by Grafana log volume panels
- OTel dotted and underscore label parity through the underscore proxy
- Series and label-value parity for labels synthesized by the proxy
- parser-stage range metrics where labelset parity must match Loki under compatibility execution
- `rate_counter(... | unwrap ...)` reset-aware semantics and error-class parity
- logfmt numeric field type inference for unwrap dropdown visibility (v1.17.0)
- bare `| unwrap` intermediate-state handling (v1.17.0)
- metric label pollution when synthesizing `detected_level` (v1.17.1)
- nested JSON object exclusion from detected_fields body scan (v1.17.1)
- `label_replace`/`label_join`/`group`/`count_values` metric transformation parity (v1.21.x)
- `service_name` alias in detected_fields for hybrid OTel/non-OTel datasets (v1.30.0)
- bare parser-stage metric label scoping (v1.31.0)
- parser-stage tumbling-window fast path via VL native stats (v1.31.2)
- `| drop field=value` matcher-form conditional semantics via proxy post-processing (v1.36.1)
- structuredMetadata vs parsedFields classification fix using `_msg` JSON content comparison (v1.36.0)
- implicit many-to-one binary matching rejection and bare-parser `unwrap duration()`/`bytes()` conversion (v1.68.0)

## Query Families In The Loki Semantics Matrix

The Loki semantics matrix focuses on query combinations where the proxy should match Loki as closely as possible on:

- HTTP status
- payload `status`
- `errorType`
- `resultType`
- line-count parity for log streams
- series-count parity for vectors and matrices
- exact metric-label-set parity for label-sensitive metric families such as bare parser metrics

The tracked operation inventory in [query-semantics-operations.json](../test/e2e-compat/query-semantics-operations.json) is machine-checked in CI. Every matrix case must belong to at least one inventory operation, and every inventory operation must reference live matrix cases.

Covered valid families:

| Family | Representative cases |
|---|---|
| Stream selectors | exact match, multi-label match, regex, negative match |
| Line filters | `|=`, `!=`, `|~`, `!~`, chained filter pipelines, negative-regex exclusions |
| Parser pipelines | `json`, `logfmt`, `regexp`, `pattern`, parser plus exact/regex/numeric field filter, `label_format` |
| Metric range queries | `count_over_time`, `rate`, `bytes_over_time`, `bytes_rate`, `absent_over_time`, grouped range aggregations, parser-inside-range filters, bare unwrap range functions |
| Aggregations | `sum by(...)`, `without(...)`, `topk(...)`, `bottomk(...)`, `sort(...)`, `sort_desc(...)` |
| Binary operations | scalar comparisons/math, `bool` comparisons, and vector-to-vector operations such as `/`, `and`, `or`, and `unless` over valid metric expressions |

Detailed operation inventory:

| Category | Operations currently enforced in CI |
|---|---|
| Selectors | exact selectors, multi-label regex selectors, negative-regex selectors |
| Line filters | `|=`, `!=`, `|~`, `!~`, mixed chained filters |
| Parsers | `json`, `logfmt`, `regexp`, `pattern` plus parsed/extracted field filters |
| Formatting | `line_format`, `label_format`, `keep`, `drop` |
| Metric functions | `count_over_time`, `rate`, `bytes_over_time`, `bytes_rate`, `absent_over_time`, `sum/avg/max/min/first/last/stddev/stdvar_over_time` with `unwrap`, `quantile_over_time` with `unwrap` |
| Aggregations | `sum by(...)`, `sum without(...)`, `topk`, `bottomk`, `sort`, `sort_desc` |
| Binary operators | scalar math/comparison, scalar `bool` comparison, vector arithmetic, `on(...)`, `group_left(...)`, logical `and`, `or`, `unless` |
| Invalid shapes | log-query aggregation misuse, missing metric range, malformed selector/parser syntax, invalid log-query binary ops; all now return HTTP 400 with Loki-matching `parse error` text |

Explicit invalid families:

| Family | Representative cases |
|---|---|
| Metric aggregation over a log query | `sum by(job) ({selector})` |
| Post-aggregation over a log query | `topk(2, {selector})`, `sort({selector})` |
| Missing range on a metric function | `rate({selector})` |
| Malformed selector / syntax | broken braces (`{app=}`), unclosed selector (`{app="x"`), parser syntax errors |
| Invalid binary shape | log-query to scalar/vector binary expressions (`{app="x"} == {app="y"}`, `count_over_time(...) + {selector}`) |

These are intentionally called out because they are easy to regress while changing translation, shaping, or query planning.

## What Stays Outside Loki Parity

Some important compatibility behavior is still tested, but it is not part of the strict Loki parity matrix:

- synthetic `service_name` recovery when the backend only has structured metadata
- Drilldown helper endpoints like detected labels, detected fields, field values, volume, and patterns
- stale-on-error helper behavior under VictoriaLogs failures

Those cases live in the proxy contract suite because Loki itself is not the source of truth for them.

## Parity Rule

Valid Loki behavior is not an allowed exclusion category.

If a query shape works in real Loki and the proxy does not match it, that is treated as a parity bug and should be fixed or tracked with an explicit regression case. The bare parser-metric and bare `unwrap` metric shapes now live inside the required matrix for that reason.

## Detailed Edge Cases Now Gated

The required matrix is intentionally not limited to happy-path selectors. It now includes:

- parser-derived metric labelsets, not just result counts
- bare `unwrap` range functions where Loki keeps parsed labels but not the unwrap target field itself
- `pattern` parser extraction semantics
- set-style binary operators such as `or` and `unless`
- `bool` comparison semantics on metric expressions
- parser-stage metric compatibility path selection for `query` and `query_range` when backend stats semantics diverge
- `rate_counter` parity for parser and non-parser query forms
- metric aggregations that do not group by service labels must not receive synthetic `service_name="unknown_service"` in query/query_range responses
- invalid log/metric shape rejections that must fail with the same class of error as Loki
- `offset` modifier -- time-shifting parity (fully implemented since v1.32.0)
- `unpack` parser -- translates to `unpack_json`, e2e parity tested
- `unwrap duration()` / `unwrap bytes()` conversion modifiers -- proxy-side conversion parity
- `label_replace()` -- proxy-side post-processing implementation, parity tested
- `|>` / `!>` pattern match line filter -- Loki 3.7+ support, parity tested

When a new LogQL family is implemented or fixed in the proxy, the expectation is to add:

1. a runtime matrix case in `query-semantics-matrix.json`
2. an inventory entry in `query-semantics-operations.json`
3. a local or unit regression if the fix needed proxy-side translation or shaping changes

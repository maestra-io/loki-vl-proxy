# Peer Cache Design

> **Note**: This document describes the initial design. For the current implementation, see [Fleet Cache Architecture](fleet-cache.md).

## Problem

When running multiple proxy replicas behind a load balancer, each maintains an independent cache. This means:
- Cache hit rate drops proportionally with replica count (N replicas = ~1/N hit rate per replica)
- VL backend receives N times more identical queries
- Cold starts after rollouts wipe all caches simultaneously

## Solution: Sharded Fleet Cache

A three-tier caching architecture with peer-aware consistent hashing:

```mermaid

    REQ["Client Request"] --> L1["L1: In-Memory Cache<br/>~2us latency"]
    L1 -->|miss| L2["L2: Disk Cache (bbolt)<br/>~1ms latency"]
    L2 -->|miss| L3["L3: Peer Cache (HTTP)<br/>~1-5ms latency"]
    L3 -->|miss| VL["VictoriaLogs<br/>~10-100ms latency"]
```

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Consistent hashing (not gossip) | Zero background traffic, deterministic routing |
| Owner write-through + shadow copies | Non-owner long-TTL writes can warm owner shards while local shadows stay short-lived |
| TTL preservation (not extension) | Never serve stale data beyond original intent |
| MinUsableTTL = 5s | Don't transfer data that expires in transit |
| Per-peer circuit breaker | Isolate failures, auto-recover after cooldown |
| No disk encryption | Delegated to cloud provider (EBS/PD at rest) |

## Configuration

```bash
# Kubernetes (DNS discovery via headless service; peers are reached on port 3100)
./loki-vl-proxy \
  -peer-self=$(hostname -i):3100 \
  -peer-discovery=dns \
  -peer-dns=proxy-headless.ns.svc.cluster.local \
  -peer-auth-token=shared-secret

# Static peer list
./loki-vl-proxy \
  -peer-self=10.0.0.1:3100 \
  -peer-discovery=static \
  -peer-static=10.0.0.1:3100,10.0.0.2:3100,10.0.0.3:3100 \
  -peer-auth-token=shared-secret
```

Discovery modes are `dns` (headless A records, fixed peer port `3100`), `srv` (DNS SRV, port from the record), `http` (JSON peer list) and `static`. The peer cache is enabled only when both `-peer-self` and `-peer-discovery` are set.

For full details including request flow diagrams, TTL preservation, circuit breaker states, performance characteristics, and large-fleet startup coordination, see [Fleet Cache Architecture](fleet-cache.md).

Current implementation notes:

- the current chart can wire peer discovery automatically through `peerCache.enabled=true`, including `-peer-auth-token` from `peerCache.authToken`, `peerCache.existingSecret`, or a generated `<release>-peer-auth` Secret
- larger `/_cache/get` responses can be `zstd`- or `gzip`-compressed between peers
- `-peer-write-through=true` is enabled by default; non-owner writes above `-peer-write-through-min-ttl` are pushed to owners
- `-peer-auth-token` is required when peer discovery is configured: the proxy refuses to start without it unless `-peer-insecure-ip-allowlist=true` restores the legacy IP-membership check. All `/_cache/*` endpoints compare `X-Peer-Token` in constant time and return `401` on mismatch
- `GET /_cache/peers` returns the current ring (`peers`, `self`, `count`); `POST /admin/cache/flush?peers=1` purges the local caches and fans out `POST /_cache/purge` to every peer (see [Ring-Wide Cache Flush](fleet-cache.md#ring-wide-cache-flush))
- `/_cache/has?keys=k1,k2,...` is a lightweight batch presence endpoint (no value data transferred) used by the startup warmup to discover which peer has the freshest copy of each label window before fetching; see [Startup Coordination](fleet-cache.md#startup-coordination-and-fleet-restart-safety)
- `-warmup-max-jitter` spreads fleet startup queries across a configurable window to prevent thundering herd on rolling restarts

# Observability Guide

Loki-VL-proxy emits the same core operational signals in two forms:

| Signal | Transport | Format | Best use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Metrics | Pull | Prometheus text at `/metrics` | Prometheus, Grafana Agent, Alloy, VictoriaMetrics, kube scraping |
| Metrics | Push | OTLP HTTP JSON to `/v1/metrics` | OpenTelemetry Collector, vendor OTLP gateways |
| Logs | Stream | Structured JSON on stdout/stderr | Fluent Bit, Vector, OpenTelemetry Collector, Docker/Kubernetes log agents |

The intent is parity, not two separate products. Prometheus scrape and OTLP push carry the same proxy-centric metric families, units, and low-cardinality request dimensions for the important operational paths. Prometheus uses label keys such as `system`, `direction`, `endpoint`, `route`, and `status`; OTLP exports the same dimensions as semantically aligned attributes such as `loki.api.system`, `proxy.direction`, `loki.request.type`, `http.route`, and `http.response.status_code`.

That shared model is what makes the packaged dashboard portable across scrape-backed and OTLP-backed setups without rewriting the operator view:

- request volume and latency
- backend latency
- cache hit/miss behavior
- translation failures
- tenant and client hot spots
- client status and query-length outliers
- process/runtime and host-level health

The proxy also now keeps more expensive metadata paths deliberately warmer than live log queries:

- live query and tail paths stay on short TTLs so fresh log visibility is not stretched unnecessarily
- slower-changing metadata such as labels, field lists, field values, and patterns are cached more aggressively
- Drilldown prefers backend-native metadata discovery where it is safe, which reduces proxy-side rescans and lowers CPU pressure on repeated field/label browsing

## Observability Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /ready` | Readiness probe (checks backend `/health` and circuit-breaker state) |
| `GET /metrics` | Prometheus text exposition. Off by default in the binary (`-server.register-instrumentation=false`); when enabled it is served on `-listen`, or on `-metrics-listen` when set. The Helm chart enables it on a dedicated `:9091` listener. Bounded by `-server.metrics-max-concurrency` |
| `GET /debug/queries` | Query analytics endpoint (disabled by default, `-server.enable-query-analytics`) |
| `GET /debug/pprof/` | Go pprof profiling endpoints (disabled by default, `-server.enable-pprof`) |

Admin and debug routes (`/admin/*`, `/debug/*`) are served on the loopback `-admin-listen` address (default `127.0.0.1:3101`) unless `-server.admin-auth-token` is set, in which case they move to the main listener and require the token.

## Logs

### JSON Log Shape

Default logs are emitted as JSON and already use OTel-friendly top-level keys:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-04-05T18:03:27.214918Z",
  "severity": {
    "text": "INFO",
    "number": 9
  },
  "body": "request",
  "component": "proxy",
  "http.route": "/loki/api/v1/query_range",
  "url.path": "/loki/api/v1/query_range",
  "http.request.method": "GET",
  "http.response.status_code": 200,
  "loki.request.type": "query_range",
  "loki.api.system": "loki",
  "proxy.direction": "downstream",
  "event.duration": 42000000,
  "loki.tenant.id": "team-a",
  "loki.query": "{service_name=\"api\"} |= \"error\"",
  "client.address": "10.0.0.12:51884",
  "enduser.id": "grafana-user@example.com",
  "enduser.source": "grafana_user",
  "cache.result": "miss",
  "proxy.duration_ms": 42,
  "upstream.calls": 1,
  "upstream.calls_by_type": {
    "vl:select_logsql_query": 1
  },
  "upstream.status_code": 200,
  "upstream.duration_ms": 31,
  "upstream.duration_ms_by_type": {
    "vl:select_logsql_query": 31
  },
  "proxy.operations_by_type": {
    "translate_query:translated": 1
  },
  "proxy.operation_duration_ms_by_type": {
    "translate_query:translated": 4
  },
  "proxy.overhead_ms": 11
}
```

That makes the log stream usable in two ways:

- plain JSON ingestion with no transformation
- low-friction mapping into the OpenTelemetry log data model

### Log Sources

The proxy writes structured logs for:

- request lifecycle and status
- query translation and backend request flow
- tail/WebSocket behavior
- delete audit events
- cache warmer and disk cache internals
- OTLP export failures

### Adaptive Log Sampling

At low traffic (below `-log-rate-threshold`, default 10 req/s), every request is
logged individually for easy debugging. When traffic exceeds the threshold, the
proxy switches to a summary mode:

- **OK traffic (2xx/3xx)**: individual request logs are suppressed. A periodic
  summary is printed every `-log-stats-interval` (default 10s) with total
  requests, error count, average/max latency, and cache hit rate.
- **Errors (4xx/5xx)**: always logged. At high error rates, repeated status codes
  are collapsed into digest lines (e.g., "429 x312 in last 10s") instead of one
  line per request.

This keeps logs useful for troubleshooting without flooding pipelines during
normal traffic.

| Flag | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `-log-buffered` | `true` | Write logs in the background for lower request latency |
| `-log-rate-threshold` | `10` | Req/s above which OK logs become periodic summaries |
| `-log-stats-interval` | `10s` | How often to print the request statistics summary |

### OpenTelemetry Fields Used in Logs

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `timestamp` | event time |
| `severity.text` / `severity.number` | log severity |
| `body` | message body |
| `component` | internal subsystem (`proxy`, `disk_cache`, `cache_warmer`, `otlp_metrics`) |
| `http.*` / `url.path` | request semantics and normalized route vs actual request path |
| `http.parent_route` | parent downstream route template on upstream child-call logs |
| `event.duration` | request or upstream call duration in nanoseconds |
| `client.address` | remote address |
| `enduser.id` | stable trusted user/client identity when available |
| `enduser.name` | display/login user name from trusted user headers when available |
| `enduser.source` | trusted header source for end-user attribution (`grafana_user`, `forwarded_user`, etc.) |
| `auth.source` | datasource auth mechanism when the request carries Basic-Auth credentials (the principal itself is never logged; separate from `enduser.id`) |
| `cache.result` | compatibility cache result (`hit`, `miss`, `bypass`) |
| `proxy.*` | proxy-facing convenience fields such as total request duration and measured proxy overhead |
| `upstream.*` | backend call count, status, and latency |
| `loki.*` | Loki/proxy-specific attributes |

Additional request-scope aggregate fields used for fanout visibility:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `loki.parent_request.type` | parent downstream request type on upstream child-call logs |
| `upstream.calls_by_type` | per-parent aggregate map keyed by `<system>:<request_type>` |
| `upstream.duration_ms_by_type` | per-parent aggregate latency map keyed by `<system>:<request_type>` |
| `proxy.operations_by_type` | per-parent aggregate map keyed by `<operation>:<outcome>` for proxy-only work |
| `proxy.operation_duration_ms_by_type` | per-parent aggregate latency map keyed by `<operation>:<outcome>` |

These aggregate map keys are intentionally bounded by route templates and hardcoded operation/outcome enums. They are log fields, not metric labels.

## Metrics

### Export Modes

#### Prometheus Scrape

`/metrics` is not served unless `-server.register-instrumentation=true`. The Helm chart sets it and serves `/metrics` on a dedicated metrics listener (`extraArgs.metrics-listen: ":9091"`, exposed as the `metrics` Service port). A binary without `-metrics-listen` serves `/metrics` on its `-listen` port.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: loki-vl-proxy
    scrape_interval: 15s
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - loki-vl-proxy:9091
```

#### OTLP Push

```bash
./loki-vl-proxy \
  -backend=http://victorialogs:9428 \
  -otlp-endpoint=http://otel-collector:4318/v1/metrics \
  -otlp-interval=30s \
  -otlp-compression=gzip \
  -otlp-headers='Authorization=Bearer example-token'
```

If the OTLP endpoint is passed as a collector base URL like `http://collector:4318` or `http://collector:4318/v1`, the proxy normalizes it to `/v1/metrics`.

### OpenTelemetry Resource Attributes for Metrics and Logs

These flags shape OTLP metric resource attributes. Structured logs intentionally do
not duplicate resource attributes per line; keep service identity in collector/OTLP
resource metadata to avoid `message.service.*` duplication in storage.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-otel-service-name` | `service.name` |
| `-otel-service-namespace` | `service.namespace` |
| `-otel-service-instance-id` | `service.instance.id` |
| `-deployment-environment` | `deployment.environment.name` |

### Request Dimensions

Request-oriented metrics use stable low-cardinality dimensions so dashboards can slice by user-visible API shape without leaking raw paths or query content.

| Dimension | Prometheus scrape | OTLP push | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| API system | `system` | `loki.api.system` | `loki`, `vl` |
| Direction | `direction` | `proxy.direction` | `downstream`, `upstream` |
| Request type | `endpoint` | `loki.request.type` | `query_range`, `labels`, `patterns` |
| Route template | `route` | `http.route` | `/loki/api/v1/query_range`, `/select/logsql/query` |
| Final status | `status` | `http.response.status_code` | `200`, `429`, `500` |

Downstream routes are the normalized Loki API templates registered by the proxy. Upstream routes are the stable VictoriaLogs or rules/alerts backend path templates used by the proxy itself. Raw request paths and query strings stay in logs, not in metric labels.

Tenant and client metric families are the only intentionally high-cardinality families, and even those are bounded with `-metrics.max-tenants` and `-metrics.max-clients`; excess identities collapse to `__overflow__`.

Histogram helper series (`_bucket`, `_sum`, `_count`) inherit the same label set and cardinality as the parent metric family.

### Cardinality Levels

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Low` | no labels or only fixed route templates / small enums (`status`, `direction`, `mode`, `reason`) |
| `Medium` | bounded internal enums that may grow slowly with feature surface but not with traffic shape |
| `High (capped)` | user or tenant identity dimensions; bounded by `-metrics.max-tenants` / `-metrics.max-clients` with `__overflow__` fallback |

| `loki_vl_proxy_http_connection_rotations_total` | counter | `reason` | `Low` | downstream HTTP/1.x connection rotations triggered by the proxy |

`tier="l0"` is the hot-key index that sits alongside the lookup tiers, not a lookup tier itself: `requests` counts every cache request that touched it, `hits` counts requests whose key was already hot, `misses` counts first observations of a key, and `cache_objects{tier="l0"}` is the current bounded index population.

Operational notes for these hot paths:

- `query_range` and `labels` benchmarks in CI track both cache-hit and cache-bypass behavior
- multi-tenant read fanout and merged response bodies are capped to keep a single request from exhausting proxy memory
- synthetic tail keeps bounded dedup state so long-running websocket sessions do not grow without limit

### Peer Cache Metrics

When the peer cache is enabled, `/metrics` appends these fleet-cache families (Prometheus scrape only). They mirror the counters in `PeerCache.Stats()`:

| Metric | Type | Labels | Cardinality | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_peers` | gauge | none | `Low` | remote peers currently in the fleet-cache ring, excluding self |
| `loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_cluster_members` | gauge | none | `Low` | total ring members, including this instance |

| `loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_error_reason_total` | counter | `reason` | `Low` | peer-cache fetch errors by reason (emitted once any error has been recorded) |
| `loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_write_through_pushes_total` | counter | none | `Low` | successful owner write-through pushes |
| `loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_write_through_errors_total` | counter | none | `Low` | owner write-through push errors |
| `loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_hot_index_requests_total` | counter | none | `Low` | peer hot-index requests |
| `loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_hot_index_errors_total` | counter | none | `Low` | peer hot-index request errors |

| `loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_read_ahead_budget_drops_total` | counter | none | `Low` | read-ahead candidates dropped by budget or size filters |
| `loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_read_ahead_tenant_skips_total` | counter | none | `Low` | read-ahead candidates skipped by tenant fairness |

Cross-tier peer lookups are also visible as `loki_vl_proxy_cache_tier_*{tier="l3_peer"}`. `GET /_cache/peers` returns the current ring membership as JSON (see [Fleet Cache](fleet-cache.md)).

### Tenant and Client Metrics

These are the metrics to use when you want to identify the users or tenants actually causing backend load.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Cardinality | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `loki_vl_proxy_tenant_requests_total` | counter | `system`, `direction`, `tenant`, `endpoint`, `route`, `status` | `High (capped)` | request volume by tenant |
| `loki_vl_proxy_tenant_request_duration_seconds` | histogram | `system`, `direction`, `tenant`, `endpoint`, `route` | `High (capped)` | latency by tenant |
| `loki_vl_proxy_client_requests_total` | counter | `system`, `direction`, `client`, `endpoint`, `route` | `High (capped)` | request volume by client identity |
| `loki_vl_proxy_client_response_bytes_total` | counter | `client` | `High (capped)` | response bytes by client |
| `loki_vl_proxy_client_status_total` | counter | `system`, `direction`, `client`, `endpoint`, `route`, `status` | `High (capped)` | final status breakdown by client |
| `loki_vl_proxy_client_inflight_requests` | gauge | `client` | `High (capped)` | current parallelism by client |
| `loki_vl_proxy_client_request_duration_seconds` | histogram | `system`, `direction`, `client`, `endpoint`, `route` | `High (capped)` | request latency by client |
| `loki_vl_proxy_client_query_length_chars` | histogram | `system`, `direction`, `client`, `endpoint`, `route` | `High (capped)` | query size outliers by client |
| `loki_vl_proxy_client_errors_total` | counter | `system`, `direction`, `endpoint`, `route`, `reason` | `Low` | categorized downstream client errors |

This is one of the main advantages of putting an explicit proxy between the
Grafana Loki datasource and VictoriaLogs: the read path becomes attributable.

Instead of only seeing aggregate datasource traffic, operators can see:

- which Grafana user or trusted client identity is generating load
- which tenant is hot
- which route is expensive for that client or tenant
- which client is producing the largest responses, longest queries, or most bad requests

### Grafana Client Visibility, Offenders, and User Patterns

When `-metrics.trust-proxy-headers=true` is enabled behind a trusted Grafana or
auth proxy, the proxy can turn northbound identity into durable read-path
signals without using raw datasource credentials as the end-user key.

That gives you:

- per-client request rate by route via `loki_vl_proxy_client_requests_total`
- per-client latency by route via `loki_vl_proxy_client_request_duration_seconds`
- per-client response-volume visibility via `loki_vl_proxy_client_response_bytes_total`
- per-client query-size outlier visibility via `loki_vl_proxy_client_query_length_chars`
- per-client bad-request and error clustering via `loki_vl_proxy_client_status_total` and `loki_vl_proxy_client_errors_total`
- per-tenant volume and latency visibility via `loki_vl_proxy_tenant_*`

Those tenant and client identity series are opt-in. Set `-metrics.export-sensitive-labels=true` only on trusted scrape or OTLP paths where exposing identity labels is acceptable.

At log level, the same request can also carry:

- `enduser.id`
- `enduser.name`
- `enduser.source`
- `auth.source`
- `loki.tenant.id`
- `http.route`

Per-request by-type breakdown maps such as `upstream.calls_by_type` and
`proxy.operations_by_type` are emitted only at debug level. The default info-level
request logs keep aggregate counts while the detailed per-type visibility stays in
Prometheus/OTLP metrics. This avoids log-body field explosion in pipelines that
flatten structured JSON bodies into discoverable `message.*` fields.

That separation matters:

- `enduser.*` answers "which Grafana user or trusted client triggered this?"
- `auth.source` answers "which datasource auth mechanism was used on the request path?" (for example `basic_auth`; the Basic-Auth username is credential material and is never logged)
- `loki.tenant.id` answers "which tenant boundary did the request execute in?"

This is what makes offender analysis practical on the read path instead of only
looking at coarse IP-level traffic.

### Northbound and Southbound Auth Boundaries

The same proxy layer also improves trust separation between components.

| Boundary | Main controls | Why it matters operationally |
|---|---|---|
| Grafana or client -> proxy | `-auth.enabled`, `-tls-client-ca-file`, `-tls-require-client-cert`, trusted user headers with `-metrics.trust-proxy-headers` | Lets the proxy require tenant context, optionally require client certs, and attribute read traffic to the actual Grafana user or trusted upstream identity when sensitive metrics export is explicitly enabled. |
| Proxy -> VictoriaLogs | `-backend-basic-auth`, `-forward-authorization`, `-forward-headers` | Lets the lower layer keep its own auth boundary while the proxy preserves full Loki-client compatibility on the northbound side. |
| Proxy -> peer cache | `-peer-auth-token` | Prevents peer-cache reuse from becoming an unauthenticated east-west path. Required whenever peer discovery is configured; the proxy refuses to start without it unless `-peer-insecure-ip-allowlist=true` restores the legacy IP-only check. |
| Operator -> admin/debug endpoints | `-server.admin-auth-token`, `-admin-listen` | Protects admin and troubleshooting surfaces without weakening the main read path. Without a token, `/admin/*` and `/debug/*` live on the loopback `-admin-listen` address (default `127.0.0.1:3101`); when instrumentation, pprof or query analytics is enabled, the proxy refuses to start if those routes would be exposed on a non-loopback address without the token. |

When trusted proxy headers are enabled, the proxy also forwards derived context
headers to VictoriaLogs:

- `X-Loki-VL-Client-ID`
- `X-Loki-VL-Client-Source`

That gives the lower layer better context about who is really behind the read
traffic while still preserving datasource compatibility at the Grafana edge.

### Runtime and Process Metrics

The proxy also exports a lightweight built-in set of runtime and process/container health metrics.
App-scoped aliases are emitted with the `loki_vl_proxy_` prefix, while legacy `go_*` and `process_*` families remain for compatibility:

Grouped family rows below mean every concrete metric name in that family shares the same cardinality profile.

| Metric family | Labels | Cardinality | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `loki_vl_proxy_go_memstats_*`, `loki_vl_proxy_go_goroutines`, `loki_vl_proxy_go_gc_cycles_total`, `loki_vl_proxy_go_gc_duration_seconds` | none | `Low` | Go runtime health |
| `loki_vl_proxy_process_resident_memory_bytes`, `loki_vl_proxy_process_open_fds` | none | `Low` | process resource usage |
| `loki_vl_proxy_process_cpu_seconds_total` | none | `Low` | total user and system CPU time of the proxy process, in seconds |
| `loki_vl_proxy_process_cpu_usage_ratio` | `mode` | `Low` | CPU pressure split by `user`, `system`, `iowait` |
| `loki_vl_proxy_process_memory_*` | none | `Low` | total, free, available, usage ratio |
| `loki_vl_proxy_process_disk_*_bytes_total` | none | `Low` | disk I/O byte counters |
| `loki_vl_proxy_process_disk_*_operations_total` | none | `Low` | disk read/write operation counters |
| `loki_vl_proxy_process_network_*_bytes_total` | none | `Low` | network I/O counters |
| `loki_vl_proxy_process_pressure_*_{some,full}_ratio` | `window` | `Low` | Linux PSI gauges when available (`10s`, `60s`, `300s`) |

Legacy unprefixed compatibility aliases (`go_*`, `process_*`) follow the same label sets and cardinality profile as their `loki_vl_proxy_*` counterparts.

Kubernetes notes:
- These runtime/system metrics are read from `/proc` and do not require Kubernetes RBAC permissions.
- PSI metrics (`process_pressure_*`) depend on kernel support and may be absent on nodes without `/proc/pressure/*`.
- On startup, the proxy logs a system-metrics readiness check with missing families and remediation hints instead of failing silently.
- Host-scope reads (`stat`, `meminfo`, `pressure/{cpu,memory,io}`) use `-host-proc-root`; self/container-scope reads (`self/*`, `net/dev`) use `-proc-root` (both default to `/proc`). With `systemMetrics.hostProc.enabled=true` (default) the chart mounts only those five host files read-only under `/host/proc` and sets `-host-proc-root=/host/proc`; it never mounts the whole host `/proc`.
- For per-pod attribution in OTLP backends, set `OTEL_SERVICE_INSTANCE_ID` from pod name and `OTEL_SERVICE_NAMESPACE` from pod namespace (the upstream chart now injects these by default).
- CI includes a metric-name guard so new app metrics must stay under the `loki_vl_proxy_*` prefix unless explicitly allowlisted for compatibility.

### PromQL Drilldowns For Slowness And Client Errors

Use these queries to quickly isolate downstream client pain, upstream slowness, and route-specific cache efficiency:

| Goal | Query |
|---|---|
| Downstream p95 latency by route | `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(loki_vl_proxy_request_duration_seconds_bucket{system="loki",direction="downstream"}[5m])) by (le, endpoint, route))` |
| Upstream p95 latency by route | `histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(loki_vl_proxy_backend_duration_seconds_bucket{system="vl",direction="upstream"}[5m])) by (le, endpoint, route))` |
| Downstream 5xx rate by route | `sum(rate(loki_vl_proxy_requests_total{system="loki",direction="downstream",status=~"5.."}[5m])) by (endpoint, route)` |
| Tenant p99 latency by route | `histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(loki_vl_proxy_tenant_request_duration_seconds_bucket{system="loki",direction="downstream"}[5m])) by (le, tenant, endpoint, route))` |
| Route cache hit ratio | `sum(rate(loki_vl_proxy_cache_hits_by_endpoint{system="loki",direction="downstream"}[5m])) by (endpoint, route) / clamp_min(sum(rate(loki_vl_proxy_cache_hits_by_endpoint{system="loki",direction="downstream"}[5m])) by (endpoint, route) + sum(rate(loki_vl_proxy_cache_misses_by_endpoint{system="loki",direction="downstream"}[5m])) by (endpoint, route), 1)` |
| Client bad_request by route | `sum(rate(loki_vl_proxy_client_errors_total{system="loki",direction="downstream",reason="bad_request"}[5m])) by (endpoint, route)` |

For latency histograms, keep dashboards on `p50`, `p95`, and `p99` rather than averages. Averages hide tail latency incidents. For exact proxy-only overhead, use structured logs (`proxy.overhead_ms`) alongside the latency histograms; subtracting histogram quantiles is not mathematically reliable.

The packaged `Loki-VL-Proxy` dashboard includes a `Process Resources` row (Section 2) with:

- memory saturation and memory footprint/headroom
- CPU usage split by mode
- disk IOPS up/down and disk throughput up/down
- network up/down
- PSI pressure (cpu/memory/io)
- process RSS and open file descriptors by pod

The dashboard is organized into three collapsible sections:

**Section 1: SLO / SLI + Health** — SLO stat strip and SLI time-series for request rate, error rate, latency, cache hit ratio, and circuit breaker state.

**Section 2: Client → Proxy → VL + Resources (Operational)** — four rows covering all operational perspectives end-to-end:

- `Client-Side Loki API Visibility` — downstream request rate, errors by reason, query length
- `Proxy Internal Visibility` — proxy internals, internal operations by type and latency
- `Backend — VictoriaLogs Visibility` — upstream backend latency, duration by endpoint, upstream fanout
- `Process Resources` — memory, CPU, disk I/O, network, PSI pressure, RSS, open FDs

**Section 3: Deep Proxy Internals (Tuning & Visibility)** — six rows for deep investigation and tuning:

- `Cache Tiers (T0/L1/L2/L3)` — per-tier hit/miss/stale rates, cache size (objects and bytes), backend fallthrough
- `Peer Cache Fleet Distribution` — active peers, peer hit/miss, peer error breakdown
- `Query-Range Windowing & Prefilter` — window cache hit/miss, prefilter efficiency, retries, partial responses
- `Patterns Engine (Grafana Logs Drilldown)` — patterns in memory, cache keys, memory bytes, mining rate, persistence
- `HTTP Connection Lifecycle` — downstream connection state, transitions, rotations
- `Tenant Deep Dive` — per-tenant request rate, P99 latency, error rate

Suggested triage path:

1. Start on Section 1 (SLO / SLI) to confirm user-visible impact and overall health.
2. Move to Section 2, `Backend — VictoriaLogs Visibility` to separate upstream pressure from proxy-side issues.
3. Use Section 2, `Client-Side Loki API Visibility` to identify offending routes, clients, or tenants.
4. Drill into Section 3 to isolate cache tier behavior, windowing, peer distribution, and runtime resource bottlenecks.

The `Query-Range Windowing & Prefilter` row (Section 3) covers both windowing cache/tuning signals and long-range resilience KPIs:

- window fetch p50/p95 latency
- window merge p50/p95 latency
- window cache hit ratio
- adaptive window parallelism + EWMA latency/error
- prefilter kept/skipped rate
- retry/degraded-batch/partial-response rate
- prefilter hit ratio

Dashboard datasource notes:

- datasource variable regex is intentionally permissive (`/.*/`) so the dashboard works with scrape-backed and OTLP-backed metric datasources without renaming
- key stat panels use explicit zero fallbacks so dashboards remain readable during cold starts and low-traffic windows

### Active Backend E2E Healthchecks

`/ready` confirms backend reachability, but production health should also include synthetic end-to-end probes with real query traffic shape.

Recommended pattern:

1. Probe `/ready` every 15-30s for hard availability.
2. Run a lightweight synthetic `query_range` every 1-5m from inside the cluster.
3. Alert when synthetic query latency or error ratio breaches SLO even if `/ready` is green.

This catches backend partial degradation (slow scans, storage pressure, auth drift) earlier than readiness alone.

## Choosing Client Identity

Per-client metrics and request logs can use trusted upstream identity instead of only remote IP:

```bash
-metrics.trust-proxy-headers=true
```

When enabled, the proxy prefers:

1. Trusted user headers (`X-Grafana-User`, `X-Forwarded-User`, `X-Webauth-User`, `X-Auth-Request-User`)
2. tenant
3. trusted forwarded client IP (`X-Forwarded-For`)
4. remote IP

Datasource/basic-auth credentials are not used as end-user identity; request logs record only the auth mechanism as `auth.source`.
Only enable trusted proxy headers when the proxy sits behind a trusted auth proxy or Grafana instance.

## Integration Examples

### OpenTelemetry Collector: scrape `/metrics` and export OTLP

```yaml

## Recommended Dashboards and Alerts

Start with:

- request rate and error rate by `endpoint`
- backend latency p95/p99 by `endpoint`
- cache hit ratio overall and by `endpoint`
- top `client` by request rate, bytes, and query length
- top `tenant` by request volume and latency
- circuit breaker state
- process RSS and open file descriptors

### Dashboard Catalog

| Dashboard | Source | Primary use |
|---|---|---|
| [`dashboard/loki-vl-proxy.json`](../dashboard/loki-vl-proxy.json) | Prometheus metrics | Service health, SLOs, cache and endpoint latency trends |

#### Metrics Dashboard Setup (Scrape and OTLP Push)

The metrics dashboard includes a `Datasource` variable and works with either metric transport mode:

- Prometheus scrape (`/metrics` + `ServiceMonitor`)
- OTLP push (`-otlp-endpoint=...`) into a Prometheus-compatible backend

Recommended setup:

1. Point `Datasource` to any Prometheus-compatible datasource that contains `loki_vl_proxy_*` metrics.
2. For scrape mode, use the datasource fed by your `ServiceMonitor`/Prometheus scrape pipeline.
3. For OTLP push mode, use the datasource fed by your OTLP metrics pipeline.
4. VictoriaMetrics can be used for both modes when it receives both scrape and OTLP streams.

Transport checklist:

- Scrape mode:
  - `-server.register-instrumentation=true` (binary default is `false`; the chart sets `true`)
  - Helm: `serviceMonitor.enabled=true`, scraping the `metrics` Service port (`extraArgs.metrics-listen`, default `:9091`)
  - Helm with the default `networkPolicy.enabled=true`: also set `networkPolicy.monitoringNamespace` (or `networkPolicy.monitoringFrom`, or an explicit `networkPolicy.monitoringAllowAll=true`), otherwise templating fails
- OTLP push mode:
  - `-otlp-endpoint` configured
  - push-only (optional): `-server.register-instrumentation=false`; with the chart also set `service.metrics.enabled=false` and clear `extraArgs.metrics-listen`, because the chart and the binary both refuse a metrics listener without instrumentation

Quick validation in Grafana Explore against the selected datasource:

```promql
loki_vl_proxy_uptime_seconds
```

If this query has data, the `Loki-VL-Proxy Metrics` dashboard should populate out of the box.

High-signal alert ideas:

- `5xx` rate rising on query endpoints
- cache hit ratio collapsing
- backend latency p95 breaching SLO
- a single `client` dominating bytes or query length
- circuit breaker opening repeatedly

The packaged alert set and incident procedures live in:

- [`alerting/loki-vl-proxy-prometheusrule.yaml`](../alerting/loki-vl-proxy-prometheusrule.yaml) — 15 alerts rendered by the Helm chart as a `PrometheusRule` (`prometheusRule.enabled=true`), each with a `runbook_url`
- [`alerting/loki-vl-proxy-alerting-rules.yaml`](../alerting/loki-vl-proxy-alerting-rules.yaml) — 16 alerts as a plain rule-group file for Prometheus, vmalert or Grafana alerting (thresholds to adjust; no runbook links, and the per-tenant alerts need `-metrics.export-sensitive-labels=true`)
- [`docs/runbooks/alerts.md`](runbooks/alerts.md)

## Notes

- OTLP push and Prometheus scrape share the same important proxy metrics and metric names.
- The OTLP export is intentionally lightweight and does not pull in the full OpenTelemetry Go SDK.
- Structured logs are already safe for JSON ingestion; agents can forward them directly or transform them into OTLP logs.

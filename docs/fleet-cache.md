# Fleet Cache Architecture

## Overview

The fleet cache enables multiple Loki-VL-proxy replicas to share cached data with minimal network overhead. Each key lives on exactly one peer (the **owner**, determined by consistent hashing). Non-owner peers fetch from the owner on local miss and keep short-lived **shadow copies**. With owner write-through enabled (default), non-owner pods also push eligible long-TTL writes to the owner shard so hot traffic pinned to one pod still warms the full fleet.

## Request Flow

### Cache Hit (Local) — 0 Hops

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant LB as Load Balancer
    participant A as Proxy A
    participant VL as VictoriaLogs

    C->>LB: query
    LB->>A: (random routing)
    A->>A: L1 check → HIT (fresh)
    A-->>C: response (0 network hops)
```

### Cache Hit (Peer) — 1 Hop

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant LB as Load Balancer
    participant A as Proxy A
    participant B as Proxy B (owner)

    C->>LB: query
    LB->>A: (random routing)
    A->>A: L1 miss, L2 miss
    A->>A: hash("query") → Proxy B
    A->>B: GET /_cache/get?key=...
    B->>B: L1 check → HIT
    B-->>A: value + X-Cache-TTL-Ms: 42000
    A->>A: store shadow (TTL=42s)
    A-->>C: response (1 hop)
```

### Cache Miss (VL Fetch)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant LB as Load Balancer
    participant A as Proxy A (owner)
    participant VL as VictoriaLogs

    C->>LB: query
    LB->>A: (random routing)
    A->>A: L1 miss, L2 miss
    A->>A: hash("query") → self (I'm owner)
    A->>A: skip L3 (I'm the authority)
    A->>VL: fetch
    VL-->>A: response
    A->>A: store in L1 (default TTL)
    A-->>C: response
```

### Non-Owner Miss + Owner Write-Through (default)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant LB as Load Balancer
    participant A as Proxy A (non-owner)
    participant B as Proxy B (owner)
    participant VL as VictoriaLogs

    C->>LB: query
    LB->>A: (random routing)
    A->>A: L1 miss, L2 miss, L3 miss
    A->>VL: fetch
    VL-->>A: response
    A->>A: store short-lived shadow (<=30s)
    A->>B: POST /_cache/set (TTL>=threshold)
    B->>B: store owner copy (full TTL)
    A-->>C: response
```

## TTL Preservation

Shadow copies use the **owner's remaining TTL**, not a fresh default:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant O as Owner (TTL=60s)
    participant N as Non-Owner

    Note over O: t=0: stores key, TTL=60s
    Note over O: t=20s: 40s remaining

    N->>O: GET /_cache/get?key=...
    O-->>N: 200 + X-Cache-TTL-Ms: 40000
    Note over N: stores shadow with TTL=40s (not 60s!)

    Note over O: t=55s: 5s remaining

    N->>O: GET /_cache/get?key=...
    O-->>N: 404 (remaining < MinUsableTTL)
    Note over N: fetches fresh data from VL
```

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "TTL Timeline"
        T0["t=0<br/>Owner stores<br/>TTL=60s"]
        T20["t=20s<br/>Peer fetches<br/>Shadow TTL=40s"]
        T55["t=55s<br/>Peer fetches<br/>remaining=5s<br/>→ 404 (force refresh)"]
        T60["t=60s<br/>Both expire"]
    end
    T0 --> T20 --> T55 --> T60
```

## Consistent Hash Ring

Keys map to peers deterministically — no communication needed:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Ring["Hash Ring (SHA256)"]
        K1["key: rate(nginx)"] -->|hash| N2["→ Proxy B"]
        K2["key: count(api)"] -->|hash| N1["→ Proxy A"]
        K3["key: sum(errors)"] -->|hash| N3["→ Proxy C"]
    end
```

**150 virtual nodes per peer** ensures even distribution:
- 2 peers → ~50/50 split
- 3 peers → ~33/33/33 split
- Adding a peer moves ~1/N keys (minimal rebalancing)

## Circuit Breaker

Per-peer circuit breaker prevents cascading failures:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed: healthy
    Closed --> Open: 5 failures
    Open --> HalfOpen: 10s cooldown
    HalfOpen --> Closed: success
    HalfOpen --> Open: failure
```

## Peer Discovery

Four discovery modes are supported. All share the same mechanics: a background goroutine re-runs discovery every `DiscoveryInterval` (default 15 s) and atomically rebuilds the consistent hash ring. Peers that disappear from the source are automatically removed; new peers that appear are added. No restart required.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    DL["discoveryLoop\n(every 15 s)"]
    DNS["dns\nnet.LookupHost\nheadless A-records"]
    SRV["srv\nnet.LookupSRV\nSRV port-embedded records"]
    HTTP["http\nHTTP GET → JSON\nConsul / Prometheus SD / custom"]
    STATIC["static\ncomma-separated list\nno refresh"]
    RING["updatePeers()\nRebuild consistent hash ring"]

    DL --> DNS
    DL --> SRV
    DL --> HTTP
    DL --> STATIC
    DNS --> RING
    SRV --> RING
    HTTP --> RING
    STATIC --> RING
```

### `dns` — Kubernetes headless service (A records)

```bash
-peer-discovery=dns
-peer-dns=loki-vl-proxy-headless.monitoring.svc.cluster.local
```

`net.LookupHost` resolves the headless service name to the IP addresses of all running pods. Each resolved IP is paired with the fixed peer port `3100` (there is no port flag), so every peer must serve its main listener on `:3100` in this mode; use `srv`, `http`, or `static` when peers listen elsewhere. In Kubernetes, a headless service DNS entry only includes pods that **pass their readiness probe** — unhealthy pods fall out of DNS within one TTL (typically 5–30 s), so the peer ring automatically excludes them.

Use when:
- Running in Kubernetes with an HPA-managed Deployment or StatefulSet
- You want readiness-probe gating to control peer inclusion automatically
- Pods have stable cluster IP (not required) but stable DNS subdomain

### `srv` — DNS SRV records

```bash
-peer-discovery=srv
-peer-srv=_loki-vl-proxy._tcp.loki-vl-proxy-headless.monitoring.svc.cluster.local
```

`net.LookupSRV` resolves a full SRV record (`_service._proto.domain`) and extracts host+port from each record. SRV records embed the port number, so each SRV record can point to a different port if required (unlike `dns` mode, which always uses port `3100`).

In Kubernetes, StatefulSet headless services publish SRV records per pod (e.g., `_http._tcp.proxy-headless.ns.svc.cluster.local`). These carry the same readiness gating as A records.

Outside Kubernetes, any DNS server that publishes SRV records works:
- HAProxy DNS resolver
- CoreDNS with custom zone
- Consul DNS (`_service._tcp.service.consul`)
- Manual BIND zone file

The SRV name format is `_service._proto.domain`. All three segments are required and must start with `_`.

### `http` — HTTP JSON endpoint

```bash
-peer-discovery=http
-peer-http-url=http://consul:8500/v1/catalog/service/loki-vl-proxy
```

The proxy fetches the configured URL every `DiscoveryInterval`. The response body is parsed as JSON and must return a list of `host:port` strings. Four response formats are supported and auto-detected:

| Format | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Simple array | `["10.0.0.1:3100","10.0.0.2:3100"]` |
| Object with `peers` key | `{"peers":["10.0.0.1:3100"]}` |
| Prometheus HTTP SD | `[{"targets":["10.0.0.1:3100"],"labels":{}}]` |
| Consul catalog | `[{"ServiceAddress":"10.0.0.1","ServicePort":3100}]` |

**Consul example** (includes health check filtering):
```bash
-peer-http-url=http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/service/loki-vl-proxy
```
Consul's `?passing=true` parameter returns only healthy instances — equivalent to Kubernetes readiness gating.

**Prometheus HTTP SD example** (custom endpoint):
```bash
-peer-http-url=http://my-registry/sd/loki-vl-proxy
```

**Nomad example**:
```bash
-peer-http-url=http://nomad:4646/v1/service/loki-vl-proxy
```

Use when:
- Running outside Kubernetes (VMs, bare metal, Nomad, Docker Swarm)
- Already using Consul or another service registry
- You have a custom service registry or health-checked load balancer
- You want fine-grained control over which instances participate in the peer ring

**How add/remove works:** The HTTP endpoint is the authoritative source. On each discovery tick the proxy fetches the URL and passes the result to `updatePeers()`. If an instance disappears from the response (failed health check, deregistered, shut down), it is removed from the hash ring within one `DiscoveryInterval`. There is no explicit register/deregister on the proxy side — that is handled by whatever manages the registry (Consul agent, health check cron, deployment tooling).

### `static` — Fixed peer list

```bash
-peer-discovery=static
-peer-static=10.0.0.1:3100,10.0.0.2:3100,10.0.0.3:3100
```

The peer list is parsed once at startup and never refreshed. Useful for small, fixed fleets where the topology does not change without a restart. Requires manual update (redeploy) when peers are added or removed.

### Peer discovery comparison

| Mode | Readiness gating | Dynamic add/remove | Works outside k8s | Port in config |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| `dns` | ✅ (k8s headless) | ✅ (every 15 s) | ⚠️ requires headless-style DNS | No (fixed `3100`) |
| `srv` | ✅ (k8s or Consul DNS) | ✅ (every 15 s) | ✅ | No (embedded in SRV) |
| `http` | ✅ (endpoint controls list) | ✅ (every 15 s) | ✅ | Yes (in response) |
| `static` | ❌ | ❌ (restart required) | ✅ | Yes (in flag) |

### Diagnostic endpoint

`GET /_cache/peers` returns the current known peer list as JSON. It is served on the main listener behind the same `X-Peer-Token` check as the other peer endpoints:

```json
{"peers":["10.0.0.1:3100","10.0.0.2:3100"],"self":"10.0.0.3:3100","count":2}
```

This reflects the ring at the moment of the request and is useful for verifying that discovery is working correctly.

## AZ-Aware Peer Selection

When a proxy instance needs to fetch a key from a peer (startup warmup, L1 miss, read-ahead), it picks the peer with the **highest remaining TTL** by default — maximising cache freshness. With AZ-aware selection enabled it applies a two-tier preference:

1. **Same-AZ peers with fresh data** — lowest latency and no cross-AZ transfer cost.
2. **Any peer with fresh data** — fallback when no same-AZ peer has the key.

This reduces cross-AZ data-transfer costs and latency in multi-AZ cloud deployments without sacrificing correctness. If no peer has the key, the proxy falls through to VictoriaLogs as usual.

### How to configure

**Flag:**
```bash
-peer-self-az=us-east-1a
```

Set this to the availability zone of the current instance. When empty (the default), AZ preference is disabled and peers are selected purely by TTL freshness.

**Helm — explicit AZ:**
```yaml
peerCache:
  enabled: true
  selfAZ: "us-east-1a"
```

**Helm — automatic detection from pod topology label (recommended for Kubernetes):**
```yaml
peerCache:
  enabled: true
  # selfAZ: ""         # empty = auto-detect from topologyLabel (default)
  topologyLabel: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"  # default; matches standard k8s node topology label

# Ensure pods carry the topology zone label so the downward API can read it:
podLabels:
  topology.kubernetes.io/zone: "us-east-1a"
```

The chart injects a `PEER_SELF_AZ` env var sourced from `metadata.labels['topology.kubernetes.io/zone']` via the Kubernetes Downward API and passes it as `-peer-self-az=$(PEER_SELF_AZ)`. If the pod does not carry the label (e.g., it was not set via `podLabels` or a platform webhook), the env var resolves to `""` and AZ preference is silently disabled.

**Kubernetes platforms that populate the topology label automatically:**

| Platform | How to enable |
|----------|--------------|
| Karpenter | Add the label to `NodePool.spec.template.metadata.labels` |
| GKE Autopilot | Use `cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool` or set `podLabels` in Helm values |
| EKS with Karpenter or managed node groups | `NodePool.spec.template.metadata.labels: {topology.kubernetes.io/zone: <zone>}` |
| Cluster with a node label syncer / mutating webhook | Labels propagated automatically |

**HTTP SD — AZ from discovery labels:**

When using `peer-discovery=http` with a Prometheus HTTP SD endpoint, the proxy extracts AZ from the target group's `labels.az` or `labels.availability_zone` field automatically — no extra flag needed:

```json
[
  {
    "targets": ["10.0.0.1:3100", "10.0.0.2:3100"],
    "labels": {"az": "us-east-1a", "env": "prod"}
  },
  {
    "targets": ["10.0.0.3:3100"],
    "labels": {"az": "us-east-1b"}
  }
]
```

Each target's AZ is stored at discovery refresh time and used during peer selection. No configuration beyond the SD labels is required.

## Configuration Examples

```bash
# Every example needs the same -peer-auth-token on all peers: the proxy refuses
# to start with peer discovery configured and no token, unless the legacy
# -peer-insecure-ip-allowlist=true (IP-membership check only) is set.

# Kubernetes: DNS discovery via headless service (single-AZ or no AZ preference)
./loki-vl-proxy \
  -peer-self=$(hostname -i):3100 \
  -peer-discovery=dns \
  -peer-dns=loki-vl-proxy-headless.monitoring.svc.cluster.local \
  -peer-auth-token=shared-secret

# Kubernetes: DNS discovery with AZ-aware peer selection
./loki-vl-proxy \
  -peer-self=$(hostname -i):3100 \
  -peer-self-az=us-east-1a \
  -peer-discovery=dns \
  -peer-dns=loki-vl-proxy-headless.monitoring.svc.cluster.local \
  -peer-auth-token=shared-secret

# Kubernetes: SRV discovery (StatefulSet with headless service)
./loki-vl-proxy \
  -peer-self=$(hostname -i):3100 \
  -peer-discovery=srv \
  -peer-srv=_loki-vl-proxy._tcp.loki-vl-proxy-headless.monitoring.svc.cluster.local \
  -peer-auth-token=shared-secret

# Consul (health-checked, works outside k8s)
./loki-vl-proxy \
  -peer-self=$(hostname -i):3100 \
  -peer-discovery=http \
  -peer-http-url=http://localhost:8500/v1/catalog/service/loki-vl-proxy \
  -peer-auth-token=shared-secret

# Prometheus HTTP SD with AZ labels (AZ extracted automatically from labels.az)
./loki-vl-proxy \
  -peer-self=$(hostname -i):3100 \
  -peer-self-az=us-east-1a \
  -peer-discovery=http \
  -peer-http-url=http://my-registry/sd/loki-vl-proxy \
  -peer-auth-token=shared-secret

# Static peer list
./loki-vl-proxy \
  -peer-self=10.0.0.1:3100 \
  -peer-discovery=static \
  -peer-static=10.0.0.1:3100,10.0.0.2:3100,10.0.0.3:3100 \
  -peer-auth-token=shared-secret
```

### Helm Values

```yaml
# Minimal — chart auto-wires peer-self, peer-discovery, and peer-dns
peerCache:
  enabled: true
```

```yaml
# With AZ-aware peer selection — automatic from pod topology label
peerCache:
  enabled: true
  topologyLabel: "topology.kubernetes.io/zone"  # default

# Ensure pods carry the label (set by platform or explicitly):
podLabels:
  topology.kubernetes.io/zone: "us-east-1a"
```

```yaml
# With AZ-aware peer selection — explicit zone
peerCache:
  enabled: true
  selfAZ: "us-east-1a"
```

When you use the Helm chart, prefer `peerCache.enabled=true` and let the chart wire the discovery flags and `-peer-auth-token=$(PEER_AUTH_TOKEN)`. The token Secret is resolved in this order:

1. `peerCache.authToken` set: the chart renders `<release>-peer-auth-literal` with that value.
2. `peerCache.existingSecret` set: the chart references your Secret (key `peerCache.existingSecretKey`, default `token`) and renders none.
3. Neither set, first install: the chart generates a random 32-character token into `<release>-peer-auth`.
4. Neither set, upgrade: the chart reuses the existing `<release>-peer-auth` via Helm `lookup`.

Case 4 needs a live cluster and permission to read Secrets. Offline rendering (`helm template` in GitOps pipelines) or restricted RBAC makes `lookup` return nothing, so a new token is generated on each render and peers reject each other; pin the token with case 1 or 2 there. An explicit empty `peerCache.authToken: ""` fails templating. `extraArgs.peer-auth-token` is intentionally rejected while `peerCache.enabled=true` because the chart owns that CLI flag.

## Performance Characteristics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| L1 latency | ~2µs |
| L2 latency | ~1ms |
| L3 latency (peer) | ~1-5ms |
| VL latency | ~10-100ms |
| Background traffic | Near zero; only request-path peer fetches and write-through pushes |
| Startup warmup VL queries | ≤W (one per window, regardless of fleet size, with peer-first warmup) |
| `/_cache/has` response size | ~50 bytes per key (JSON metadata, no values) |
| Max VL calls per key | 1 (per owner) |
| Shadow copy overhead | ~0 (uses owner's remaining TTL) |
| Hash ring lookup | O(log N) |
| Discovery refresh | Every 15s (dns / srv / http modes) |

Peer fetch behavior details:

- larger `/_cache/get` payloads are compressed when peers request `Accept-Encoding`, preferring `zstd` and falling back to `gzip`
- when `-peer-write-through=true`, non-owner writes above `-peer-write-through-min-ttl` are pushed to owners via `/_cache/set`
- `-peer-auth-token` is required whenever peer discovery is configured; set the same value fleet-wide. The proxy refuses to start without it unless `-peer-insecure-ip-allowlist=true` restores the legacy check based only on the currently discovered peer IP set
- every peer endpoint (`/_cache/get`, `/_cache/set`, `/_cache/has`, `/_cache/hot`, `/_cache/peers`, `/_cache/purge`) compares `X-Peer-Token` in constant time and fails closed with `401` on a missing or wrong token

## Fleet Metrics

The `/metrics` endpoint exports fleet-specific visibility for peer-cache behavior:

```text
loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_peers                 # remote peers, excluding self
loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_cluster_members       # total ring members, including self
loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_hits_total            # successful peer fetches
loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_misses_total          # owner returned miss / near-expiry miss
loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_errors_total          # peer fetch failures
loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_write_through_pushes_total   # successful owner write-through pushes
loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_write_through_errors_total   # failed owner write-through pushes
```

Use these together with the normal client metrics to tell apart:
- backend pain caused by specific Grafana users or tenants
- cache-ring imbalance or shrinking fleets
- peer-to-peer failures that are forcing traffic back to VictoriaLogs

## Collapse Forwarding Status

Current behavior already includes request collapsing in two critical places:

- Proxy -> VictoriaLogs collapse uses singleflight coalescing (`internal/middleware/coalescer.go`) so concurrent identical requests share one upstream call.
- Peer-cache `/_cache/get` collapse uses per-key in-flight dedupe (`internal/cache/peer.go`) so concurrent non-owner pulls for the same key share one owner fetch.

Recent verification coverage:

- `TestCoalescer_DedupConcurrentRequests`
- `TestCoalescer_TenantIsolation`
- `TestPeerCache_CoalescingAndCacheIntegration`
- `TestPeerCache_ThreePeers_ShadowCopiesAvoidRepeatedOwnerFetches`

Peer payload exchange already prefers `zstd`, then `gzip`, then identity.

## Hot Read-Ahead (Bounded)

Bounded hot read-ahead is implemented and remains disabled by default (`-peer-hot-read-ahead-enabled=false`).

Runtime behavior:

1. Owners expose a compact hot-key index on `/_cache/hot` (top N keys with score, size, and remaining TTL).
2. Peers pull owner hot indexes on a periodic, jittered loop.
3. Prefetch selection is bounded and tenant-fair:
   - remaining TTL must be above threshold
   - object size must stay below prefetch object limit
   - selected keys must stay within key budget
   - selected bytes must stay within byte budget
   - first pass enforces per-tenant fairness cap, second pass backfills remaining budget
4. Prefetch fetches use existing `/_cache/get` with `Accept-Encoding: zstd, gzip`.
5. Prefetched values are inserted as local shadow copies (no write-through fanout loops).
6. Existing collapse-forwarding stays in place: concurrent pulls for the same key coalesce.

Anti-storm controls:

- max concurrency for hot-index and prefetch pulls
- strict per-interval key/byte budgets
- jittered scheduling
- circuit-breaker-aware peer selection
- error-streak backoff before next read-ahead cycle

Read-ahead observability metrics:

```text
loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_hot_index_requests_total
loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_hot_index_errors_total
loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_read_ahead_prefetches_total
loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_read_ahead_prefetch_bytes_total
loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_read_ahead_budget_drops_total
loki_vl_proxy_peer_cache_read_ahead_tenant_skips_total
```

These are additive to existing peer-cache counters and are also used by CI regression guards.

Expected effect:

- Lower VictoriaLogs fetch rate for repeatedly accessed hot keys.
- Better p95/p99 cache hit latency on non-owner replicas.
- More even read pressure across a fleet behind L4/L7 load balancers.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Consistent hashing (not gossip) | Zero background traffic, deterministic routing |
| Owner write-through + shadow copies | Preserve owner-centric cache warmth under skewed traffic while keeping non-owner shadows short-lived |
| TTL preservation (not extension) | Never serve stale data beyond original intent |
| MinUsableTTL=5s (force refresh) | Don't transfer data that expires in transit |
| Singleflight per key | Prevent cache stampede on L3 misses |
| Per-peer circuit breaker | Isolate failures, auto-recover after cooldown |
| No disk encryption | Delegated to cloud provider (EBS/PD encryption at rest) |

## Startup Coordination and Fleet Restart Safety

### The Problem: Thundering Herd

Without coordination, a rolling restart of N proxy instances causes every instance to
fire expensive metadata warmup queries to VL simultaneously:

```
t=0s: instance-1 restarts → stream_field_names [1h] → stream_field_names [6h] → ... (4 queries)
t=0s: instance-2 restarts → stream_field_names [1h] → stream_field_names [6h] → ... (4 queries)
t=0s: instance-3 restarts → ...
...
t=0s: instance-9 restarts → stream_field_names [7d] → (4 queries)

Total: 9 instances × 4 windows × 14-46s query = 36 wide-range VL queries in parallel
Result: VL OOM / restart
```

### Solution: Three-Layer Startup Defense

```

#### Layer 1: Startup Jitter

Controlled by `-warmup-max-jitter`. Each instance sleeps for a random duration
`[0, maxJitter)` before starting warmup queries. This staggers the fleet so instances
don't all hit VL simultaneously.

**Recommended settings:**

| Fleet size | `-warmup-max-jitter` | Expected VL hits per window |
|------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| 2–5 pods | `5s` | 1 (first pod only) |
| 6–15 pods | `10s` | 1–2 |
| 16–30 pods | `20s` | 2–3 |
| 30+ pods | `30s` | ≤3 |

A warmup of the 4 standard label windows takes ~2–8 s total. With `maxJitter=10s`
a pod waking up at t=4s will find fresh data from a pod that woke at t=0s.

#### Layer 2: Batch Peer Discovery (`/_cache/has`)

After jitter, each instance checks whether any peer already has the data before
touching VL. This is a **two-phase operation**:

**Phase 1 — Discovery (metadata only, no value transfer):**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant I as Instance-7<br/>(waking up at t=6s)
    participant P1 as Peer 1
    participant P2 as Peer 2
    participant PN as Peer N
    participant VL as VictoriaLogs

    Note over I: After jitter, check peers first
    par Concurrent /_cache/has requests
        I->>P1: GET /_cache/has?keys=window-1h,window-6h,window-24h,window-7d
        I->>P2: GET /_cache/has?keys=window-1h,window-6h,window-24h,window-7d
        I->>PN: GET /_cache/has?keys=window-1h,window-6h,window-24h,window-7d
    end
    P1-->>I: {"window-1h":{"ok":true,"ttl_ms":55000}, "window-6h":{"ok":true,"ttl_ms":52000}, ...}
    P2-->>I: {"window-1h":{"ok":false}, "window-6h":{"ok":false}, ...}
    PN-->>I: {"window-1h":{"ok":true,"ttl_ms":48000}, ...}
    Note over I: Peer 1 has higher TTL for window-1h (55s > 48s) → prefer Peer 1
    Note over I: Zero bytes of actual cache data transferred in phase 1
```

**Phase 2 — Targeted fetch (values only from the freshest peer):**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant I as Instance-7
    participant P1 as Peer 1 (best for window-1h, 6h, 24h)
    participant P3 as Peer 3 (best for window-7d)
    participant VL as VictoriaLogs

    I->>P1: GET /_cache/get?key=window-1h (TTL=55s)
    P1-->>I: [label list, zstd-compressed] + X-Cache-TTL-Ms: 55000
    I->>P1: GET /_cache/get?key=window-6h
    P1-->>I: [label list, compressed]
    I->>P1: GET /_cache/get?key=window-24h
    P1-->>I: [label list, compressed]
    I->>P3: GET /_cache/get?key=window-7d
    P3-->>I: [label list, compressed]
    Note over VL: VL receives zero requests from instance-7
```

#### Layer 3: Inter-Window Sleep

When an instance must fetch from VL (it's the first one up or peers had nothing),
a 500ms pause between each window prevents consecutive wide-range queries from
monopolizing VL's query concurrency slots.

### Network Traffic Analysis

#### Per-Restart Request Count

For a fleet of **P peers** warming **W label windows** (default W=4):

| Strategy | Requests per instance | Total fleet requests | Data transferred |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Old (per-key get) | P × W (worst case) | P² × W | full values × P² × W |
| New (batch has + targeted get) | P + W' (W' ≤ W) | P² + P×W' | tiny JSON × P² + values × P×W' |

**Example: 9-pod fleet restarting simultaneously**

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "VL warmup queries: old vs. new (9 pods, 4 windows)"
    x-axis ["Without coordination", "With jitter only", "Jitter + peer-first"]
    y-axis "VL queries" 0 --> 40
    bar [36, 12, 2]
```

**Example: 30-pod fleet**

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "VL warmup queries on restart (30 pods, 4 windows)"
    x-axis ["No coordination", "Jitter only (20s)", "Jitter + peer-first"]
    y-axis "VL queries" 0 --> 130
    bar [120, 12, 3]
```

The peer-first strategy means only the **first pod per window** needs to hit VL;
all subsequent pods pull from that pod. With 4 windows and staggered jitter, the
realistic steady state is 4 VL warmup queries total regardless of fleet size.

### Timeline: 30-Pod Rolling Restart

```mermaid
gantt
    title 30-pod rolling restart with maxJitter=20s (one label window shown)
    dateFormat  s
    axisFormat  %Ss

    section Instance 1 (wakes at t=1s)
    Jitter sleep       :done, j1, 0, 1s
    Peer check (miss)  :done, p1, 1s, 2s
    VL fetch (window)  :crit, v1, 2s, 6s
    Cache warm         :done, c1, 6s, 30s

    section Instance 2 (wakes at t=2s)
    Jitter sleep       :done, j2, 0, 2s
    Peer check (miss)  :done, p2, 2s, 3s
    VL fetch (window)  :crit, v2, 3s, 7s
    Cache warm         :done, c2, 7s, 30s

    section Instance 5 (wakes at t=7s)
    Jitter sleep       :done, j5, 0, 7s
    Peer check (HIT)   :active, ph5, 7s, 8s
    Pull from peer 1   :active, pf5, 8s, 9s
    Cache warm         :done, cf5, 9s, 30s

    section Instance 15 (wakes at t=11s)
    Jitter sleep       :done, j15, 0, 11s
    Peer check (HIT)   :active, ph15, 11s, 12s
    Pull from peer 2   :active, pf15, 12s, 13s
    Cache warm         :done, cf15, 13s, 30s

    section Instance 30 (wakes at t=19s)
    Jitter sleep       :done, j30, 0, 19s
    Peer check (HIT)   :active, ph30, 19s, 20s
    Pull from peer     :active, pf30, 20s, 21s
    Cache warm         :done, cf30, 21s, 30s
```

Key observation: VL only sees warmup queries from the first 2 instances. All
subsequent instances pull from peers. This is true for **any fleet size** as long
as `maxJitter` is larger than the warmup duration (~6–8s for 4 windows).

### `/_cache/has` Endpoint Reference

**`GET /_cache/has?keys=key1,key2,key3`**

Batch key-presence check. Returns JSON presence and remaining TTL for each
requested key. No value data is transferred — responses are tiny (~50 bytes per key).

**Query parameters:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `keys` | Comma-separated cache keys (max 200) |

**Response** — `200 OK`, `Content-Type: application/json`:

```json
{
  "labels:start=1716278400000000000&end=1716282000000000000&query=%2A": {
    "ok": true,
    "ttl_ms": 55000
  },
  "labels:start=1716257200000000000&end=1716282000000000000&query=%2A": {
    "ok": false
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ok` | `true` if key is present and has > `MinUsableTTL` (5s) remaining |
| `ttl_ms` | Remaining TTL in milliseconds; only present when `ok=true` |

**Behavior:**
- Keys near expiry (`remaining < 5s`) are reported as `ok: false` (treat as miss)
- Response can be `zstd`- or `gzip`-compressed when `Accept-Encoding` header is set
- Protected by the same `X-Peer-Token` authentication as `/_cache/get` and `/_cache/set`

**Use case — pick the freshest peer before fetching:**

```
caller → each peer: GET /_cache/has?keys=k1,k2,k3,k4   (metadata, ~200 bytes/peer)
caller ← each peer: {k1: {ok:true, ttl_ms:55000}, k2: {ok:false}, ...}
caller selects peer with highest ttl_ms per key
caller → best peer: GET /_cache/get?key=k1              (value fetch, only if needed)
```

### Peer Endpoint Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Body transferred |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `/_cache/get?key=K` | GET | Fetch value for one key | Full value (compressed) |
| `/_cache/set?key=K&ttl_ms=T` | POST | Push a value to a peer (write-through) | Full value |
| `/_cache/has?keys=k1,k2,...` | GET | Batch presence + TTL check | JSON metadata only (~50B/key) |
| `/_cache/hot?limit=N` | GET | Top N hot keys with scores and TTL | JSON index (no values) |
| `/_cache/peers` | GET | Current ring membership (`peers`, `self`, `count`) | JSON metadata only |
| `/_cache/purge` | POST | Purge this node's L0 hot index, L1 memory and L2 disk caches (fanout target of the ring-wide flush; never re-fans out) | none |

All peer endpoints are served on the main listener and require `X-Peer-Token` (see [token requirement](#performance-characteristics)).
Responses ≥1 KB are offered compressed (`zstd` preferred, `gzip` fallback).

### Ring-Wide Cache Flush

`POST /admin/cache/flush` purges the local instance's caches (L0 hot index, L1 memory, L2 disk). Adding `?peers=1` (or a bare `?peers`) also sends `POST /_cache/purge` with the shared `X-Peer-Token` to every other peer in the ring, at most 16 at a time with a 5 s timeout per peer. The JSON response reports `purged` or `error: ...` per peer; an unreachable peer does not block the rest. Peers purge only themselves, so there is no re-broadcast.

`/admin/cache/flush` is an admin route: it is registered when `-server.register-instrumentation=true` and lives on the loopback `-admin-listen` address (default `127.0.0.1:3101`) unless `-server.admin-auth-token` is set, in which case it moves to the main listener and requires the token (`Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `X-Admin-Token`). The image has no shell, so in Kubernetes reach the loopback listener with a port-forward:

```bash
kubectl port-forward pod/<proxy-pod> 3101:3101 &
curl -fsS -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:3101/admin/cache/flush?peers=1'
```

### Large-Fleet Configuration Reference

#### Kubernetes (30+ pods)

```yaml
# values.yaml
peerCache:
  enabled: true          # chart wires -peer-self=$(POD_IP):3100, -peer-discovery=dns,
                         # -peer-dns=<headless service> and -peer-auth-token from a Secret,
                         # and creates the headless peer service
  discovery: dns
  existingSecret: loki-vl-proxy-peer-token  # pin the token for GitOps/offline rendering

extraArgs:
  warmup-max-jitter: "20s"   # spread 30 pods over 20s window
```

#### Jitter Sizing Formula

```
recommended_jitter = max(single_warmup_duration × 1.5, 5s)
single_warmup_duration ≈ 4 windows × (avg_VL_latency + 500ms_inter_window_sleep)
                       ≈ 4 × (2s + 0.5s) = 10s  (typical)
recommended_jitter    ≈ 10s × 1.5 = 15s
```

For large fleets (30+ pods) add extra buffer: `recommended_jitter = 20–30s`.

#### Expected Steady-State VL Load

| Fleet size | maxJitter | VL warmup queries per full restart |
|------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| 3 pods | 5s | ≤4 (1 per window) |
| 9 pods | 10s | ≤4 |
| 20 pods | 15s | ≤4–8 |
| 30 pods | 20s | ≤4–8 |
| 50 pods | 30s | ≤8 |

The theoretical minimum is W (one VL query per label window, regardless of fleet
size) because the peer-first strategy means only the first instance per window
touches VL. In practice, 1–2 additional instances may overlap before the first
completes, giving ≤2W queries for the most contended windows.

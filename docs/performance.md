# Performance

## Architecture Optimizations

### Lock-Free Hot Paths

At high concurrency (100+ concurrent requests), mutex contention becomes the
dominant source of latency. The proxy eliminates locks from the request hot path
in several subsystems:

| Component | Before | After | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Circuit breaker | `sync.Mutex` on every `Allow()`/`RecordSuccess()` | Atomic state machine; mutex only on state transitions | Zero contention in closed (healthy) state |
| Metrics histograms | `sync.RWMutex` on `observe()` and scrape | Atomic CAS loops for all counters | Scrape no longer blocks request recording |
| Rate limiter | Single global `sync.Mutex` + `map` | `sync.Map` + per-bucket `sync.Mutex` | Eliminates convoy effect across tenants |
| Query fingerprinting | `crypto/sha256` | `hash/maphash` | ~30x faster hashing |
| Structured logging | `slog.JSONHandler` internal mutex (52% of contention at c=100) | Async buffered handler with 8192-slot channel | Writer goroutine decouples logs from request path |

### Connection Pool Tuning

The proxy's HTTP transport is tuned for high-concurrency single-backend proxying:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `MaxIdleConns` | 256 | Total idle connection pool size |
| `MaxIdleConnsPerHost` | 256 | All slots for VL (single backend) |
| `MaxConnsPerHost` | 0 (unlimited) | No artificial cap on concurrent VL connections |
| `IdleConnTimeout` | 90s | Reuse warm connections |
| `ResponseHeaderTimeout` | 120s | Allow slow VL queries to complete |
| `DisableCompression` | false | Allow negotiated upstream compression |

Go's default `MaxIdleConnsPerHost=2` causes ephemeral port exhaustion at >50 concurrent requests. Our tuning handles 200+ concurrent with 0 errors.

### Compression Path

The proxy now uses compression on multiple read-path hops:

| Hop | Current behavior |
|---|---|
| Client -> proxy response | Frontend stays on `gzip`/identity; the chart pins `-response-compression=gzip` with `-response-compression-min-bytes=1024` for broad Loki/Grafana compatibility |
| Proxy -> peer-cache owner | `/_cache/get` prefers `zstd`, then `gzip`, then identity for payloads `>=1KiB` |
| Proxy -> VictoriaLogs | `-backend-compression=auto` advertises `zstd, gzip`; the proxy decodes either safely before translation or passthrough |
| Disk cache | gzip-compressed value storage |
| OTLP push | `none`, `gzip`, or `zstd` |

Important: current VictoriaLogs docs clearly describe HTTP response compression, but not a guaranteed `zstd` query-response contract on the normal select path. The proxy can accept `zstd` from upstream when the backend provides it, but stock VictoriaLogs deployments may still return `gzip` or identity today.

Verification note: against Grafana `12.4.2`, the datasource proxy path
advertised `Accept-Encoding: deflate, gzip`, not `zstd`, in local
verification. That means the safe deployment default is frontend `gzip`,
and `-response-compression=auto` now keeps that same gzip path enabled for
legacy configs instead of maintaining a separate client-facing `zstd` mode.

The Tier0 compatibility cache now stores the canonical identity body and lazily
adds compressed variants on hot hits. That removes repeated gzip/zstd work from
the hot cached read path without forcing every cached response to occupy
multiple encodings up front.

**klauspost/compress (v1.27.0)**: The proxy uses the `klauspost/compress` library instead of the standard `compress/gzip`, providing 2.5–3× faster gzip decode throughput. This matters for responses from remote VL backends where gzip decompression is on the critical path.

**Window cache zstd (v1.27.0)**: Split-window query results are compressed with zstd before storing in the in-memory cache, achieving 5–15× size reduction compared to raw NDJSON. This allows the window cache to hold significantly more windows within the same memory budget.

**Loopback backend optimization**: When VL runs on the same host (localhost/127.0.0.1/::1), the proxy detects this and requests uncompressed responses (`identity` encoding). This eliminates 25–35% of decompress CPU overhead for co-located deployments.

### NDJSON Parsing Optimization

VL returns log results as newline-delimited JSON. The proxy converts this to Loki's streams format. Key optimizations:

| Technique | Effect |
|---|---|
| Byte scanning (not `strings.Split`) | Avoids copying entire body to string |
| `sync.Pool` for JSON entry maps | Reuses maps across NDJSON lines, reducing GC pressure |
| Pre-allocated slice capacity | Estimates line count from body size |
| Nanosecond timestamp via `strconv.FormatInt` | Avoids `fmt.Sprintf` allocation |

Result: **49% memory reduction** and **9.6% faster** parsing vs original implementation.

### Request Coalescing

When multiple clients send identical queries simultaneously, only 1 request reaches VL. Others wait for the shared result. Keys include tenant ID to prevent cross-tenant data sharing.

### Cache Topology

The proxy now has two cache layers in front of the backend execution path:

| Layer | Scope | Primary goal |
|---|---|---|
| Tier0 compatibility-edge cache | Final Loki-shaped `GET` responses on safe read endpoints | Bypass translation and backend work for hot repeated reads |
| L1/L2/L3 cache stack | Local memory, optional disk, optional peer fleet reuse | Reduce backend load and share results across replicas |

Tier0 is intentionally small and bounded as a percentage of the primary L1 memory budget. The deeper L1/L2/L3 stack still handles broader reuse, peer sharing, and persistent cache warming.

### What This Means For Operators

The simplest way to understand the cache stack is by operational outcome:

| Layer | Plain-English role | What it buys you |
|---|---|---|
| `Tier0` | Fast answer cache at the Loki-compatible frontend | Repeated Grafana reads can return before most proxy logic runs |
| `L1` memory | Hot cache inside the local process | Best-case latency for repeated dashboards and Explore refreshes |
| `L2` disk | Persistent local cache | Useful cache survives beyond RAM pressure and supports larger working sets |
| `L3` peer cache | Fleet-wide cache reuse between replicas | One warm pod can make the rest of the fleet faster and cheaper; peer-first startup warmup means only 1 instance per label window hits VL on rolling restart regardless of fleet size |

This is the difference between “it speaks Loki” and “it feels like Loki at runtime.” The project is designed to preserve Loki-compatible UX while reducing repeated backend work aggressively.

## Drilldown Metadata Performance

Grafana Logs Drilldown and the label browser make multiple metadata calls per page load. The proxy optimises these calls to eliminate the two main sources of latency: slow backend endpoints and cache key drift.

### Endpoint Selection

VictoriaLogs exposes two field-name endpoints with very different cost profiles:

| Endpoint | Index scanned | Typical latency (1h window) | Typical latency (24h window) |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| `stream_field_names` | Stream index (per-stream) | ~30ms | 5–10s |
| `field_names` | All-fields index (per-doc) | ~30ms | ~30ms |

`stream_field_names` scales linearly with data volume because it scans per-stream metadata. At 24h with a busy installation it regularly takes 5–10 seconds. `field_names` uses a separate all-fields index and is consistently ~30ms regardless of time range.

**Service-name detection** (`/loki/api/v1/label/service_name/values`, drilldown entrypoint): previously called `stream_field_names` 4× in series (~5s cold). Now calls `field_names` once (~29ms) plus `stream_field_values` per candidate field.

**Background label refresh** (`refreshLabelsCacheAsync`): previously sent the full user-requested range to `stream_field_names` — a 6h Grafana window produced a 5s background call, 24h produced a 10s call, causing CPU spikes visible as Grafana slowness. Now uses `field_names` for the full-range background path (consistently ~30ms), keeping `stream_field_names` (capped at 1h) for the synchronous labels endpoint where strict stream-only semantics matter.

### Cache Key Stability

Grafana's time picker uses a sliding end-timestamp that drifts a few seconds between requests. Before this fix, each click produced a unique cache key, defeating the 30s TTL and ensuring every click hit the backend. The fix floors the `end` timestamp to 30-second intervals so all requests within the same logical window share one cache entry.

**Measured improvement** (e2e-compat, ~8M log entries, 1h window):

| Path | Before | After (cold) | After (warm) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `service_name/values` | ~5,028ms (4 × stream_field_names) | **235ms** | **12ms** |
| Speedup | — | **21×** | **~420×** |

Wide-range background refresh: eliminated 5–10s `stream_field_names` calls for 6h/12h/24h windows. All background metadata calls now complete in &lt;100ms regardless of the Grafana time picker selection.

## VictoriaLogs Native Stats Offloading

The proxy routes as much metric aggregation as possible to VL's native `/select/logsql/stats_query_range` endpoint, which returns a Prometheus-compatible matrix directly. This eliminates the most expensive proxy path: fetching all raw log lines and aggregating them in-process.

### VL Native Stats API — Feature Timeline

| Feature | Added in VL | Release date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/select/logsql/stats_query` | v0.29.0 | 2024-09-08 | Instant stats, Prometheus vector format |
| `/select/logsql/stats_query_range` | v0.29.0 | 2024-09-08 | Range stats, Prometheus matrix format — used by Grafana |
| `count`, `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `quantile`, `stddev` | v0.29.0 | 2024-09-08 | In stats pipe |
| `rate()` and `rate_sum()` | v1.2.0 | 2024-12-06 | Native per-second rate — no proxy aggregation needed |
| `rate_sum(prefix*)` prefix wildcard | v1.25.0 | 2025-07-07 | |

The proxy's minimum tracked capability profile is `vl-v1.30-plus`. All features above are available on every backend the proxy supports — no version gating required for stats offloading.

### LogQL → VL Native Stats Mapping

| LogQL metric | VL LogsQL (`stats_query_range`) | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| `count_over_time({...}[r]) by (l)` | `{...} \| stats by (l) count()` | always |
| `rate({...}[r]) by (l)` | `{...} \| stats by (l) rate()` | range == step |
| `bytes_over_time({...}[r]) by (l)` | `{...} \| stats by (l) sum_len(_msg)` | always |
| `sum_over_time({...}\|unwrap f [r]) by (l)` | `{...} \| <parser> \| stats by (l) sum(f)` | always |
| `avg_over_time({...}\|unwrap f [r]) by (l)` | `{...} \| <parser> \| stats by (l) avg(f)` | always |
| `quantile_over_time(q, {...}\|unwrap f [r]) by (l)` | `{...} \| <parser> \| stats by (l) quantile(q, f)` | always |
| `max_over_time({...}\|unwrap f [r]) by (l)` | `{...} \| <parser> \| stats by (l) max(f)` | always |
| `min_over_time({...}\|unwrap f [r]) by (l)` | `{...} \| <parser> \| stats by (l) min(f)` | always |
| `stddev_over_time({...}\|unwrap f [r]) by (l)` | `{...} \| <parser> \| stats by (l) stddev(f)` | always |
| `bytes_rate({...}[r])` | `{...} \| stats by (l) sum_len(_msg) as __lvp_inner \| math __lvp_inner/r_s as __lvp_rate` | range == step |
| `rate_counter({...}\|unwrap f [r])` | — | manual path (monotonic counter reset detection required) |

**`rate()` / `bytes_rate()` condition — range == step:** VL's stats pipe uses tumbling windows. LogQL's `rate()` and `bytes_rate()` compute over a sliding `r` window. These are semantically identical when `r == step`, which is Grafana's default with `$__interval`. The proxy shifts the query start back by `r` and trims the pre-start bucket to match Loki's first evaluation point. Fixed ranges that differ from the step keep the proxy sliding-window path.

**Parser stage (`| json` / `| logfmt`) + range metric:** Even when `range == step`, if the translated VL query contains an `unpack_json` or `unpack_logfmt` stage, the fast stats path is disabled. VL's unpack pipes do not model Loki's `__error__` filtering (Loki excludes lines that fail to parse; VL may include them). These queries fall back to the manual log-fetch path.

**Go template or `__error__` filter in the pipeline:** routed to a dedicated
proxy-side path before every other decision. VictoriaLogs can neither evaluate a
`line_format` / `label_format` template nor flag a parse failure, so the backend
is asked for the stream selector plus the leading line filters only and the
whole pipeline is evaluated per entry. This is the most expensive route in the
table — it is chosen because the pushed-down alternative returns wrong numbers,
not slow ones. A constant format (`| line_format ""`) or a bare rename
(`| label_format new=old`) is exempt. See `docs/configuration.md`.

### Query Routing Decision

The proxy chooses between native VL stats and the manual log-fetch path based on:

```
LogQL metric query
  │
  ├─ pipeline has a {{…}} template or an __error__ filter?
  │   └─ YES → proxy-side pipeline evaluation (template_pipeline.go)
  │
  ├─ has parser stage (| json, | logfmt, etc.)?
  │   ├─ NO  → native VL stats (translator emits | stats …)
  │   └─ YES + no post-parser filter + function = rate/count/bytes + range == step
  │            BUT translated query has unpack_json/unpack_logfmt → manual path
  │            (VL unpack semantics differ from Loki __error__ filtering)
  │            function = rate_counter → always manual
  │
  └─ outer aggregation (sum/avg/topk)?
      ├─ topk/bottomk/sort → native VL stats + post-filter in proxy
      └─ sum/avg/min/max by (labels) → folded into | stats by (labels) …
```

**Why this matters:** the manual path fetches every matching log line from VL (`/select/logsql/query`), buffers them in proxy RAM, and computes rates/sums per step window. A 30-second `query_range` at `step=60s` with 1 M logs/min fetches 30 M lines; the same query via `stats_query_range` returns 30 aggregated data points. The performance ratio scales with log volume.

## Query-Range Tuning (Long-Range Efficiency)

Default tuning pattern:

- split long `query_range` requests into fixed windows (commonly `1h`)
- avoid caching near-now windows (or keep TTL very short)
- keep historical window cache TTL longer for reuse
- use adaptive bounded parallel fetch to improve range latency under healthy backend conditions

Recommended operator workflow:

1. Start with conservative adaptive bounds (for example min `2`, max `8`).
2. Observe backend latency/error EWMA and window cache hit ratio.
3. Increase max parallel only when backend latency/error stays stable.
4. Increase history TTL together with disk cache budget, not independently.

Key tuning signals:

- `loki_vl_proxy_window_cache_hit_total`
- `loki_vl_proxy_window_cache_miss_total`
- `loki_vl_proxy_window_fetch_seconds`
- `loki_vl_proxy_window_merge_seconds`
- `loki_vl_proxy_window_prefilter_attempt_total`
- `loki_vl_proxy_window_prefilter_error_total`
- `loki_vl_proxy_window_prefilter_kept_total`
- `loki_vl_proxy_window_prefilter_skipped_total`
- `loki_vl_proxy_window_prefilter_duration_seconds`
- `loki_vl_proxy_window_adaptive_parallel_current`
- `loki_vl_proxy_window_adaptive_latency_ewma_seconds`
- `loki_vl_proxy_window_adaptive_error_ewma`

Capacity approximation for history window caching:

`required_disk_bytes ~= unique_windows_per_day * avg_window_bytes * ttl_days`

Always cap disk cache explicitly with `-disk-cache-max-bytes` for predictable retention and node usage.

## Benchmark Results

Measured on Apple M3 Max (14 cores), Go 1.26.2, `-benchmem`.

### Long-Range Phase Program Benchmarks (1h split windows)

Command:

```bash
go test ./internal/proxy -run '^$' -bench 'BenchmarkQueryRangeWindowing_(NoPrefilter|WithPrefilter|StreamAwareBatching_Off|StreamAwareBatching_On)$' -benchmem -benchtime=10x
```

| Benchmark | ns/op | hits_calls/op | query_calls/op | max_inflight | allocs/op | Key result |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `NoPrefilter` | 39,525,225 | 0 | 49 | n/a | 11,582 | baseline full fanout |
| `WithPrefilter` | 11,672,412 | 48 | 9 | n/a | 10,346 | ~81.6% fewer backend query calls |
| `StreamAwareBatching_Off` | 17,048,771 | n/a | n/a | 4 | 9,490 | higher concurrency under load |
| `StreamAwareBatching_On` | 62,808,025 | n/a | n/a | 1 | 9,656 | lower concurrency spikes, more stable backend pressure |

Notes:

- Prefiltering is the largest direct backend-load reduction lever for sparse long ranges.
- Stream-aware batching intentionally trades raw synthetic throughput for lower backend saturation risk and fewer breaker cascades on real 2d/7d traffic.

### Per-Request Latency

| Operation | Latency | Allocs | Bytes/op |
|---|---|---|---|
| Labels (cache hit) | 2.0 us | 25 | 6.6 KB |
| QueryRange (cache hit) | 118 us | 600 | 142 KB |
| wrapAsLokiResponse | 2.8 us | 58 | 2.6 KB |
| VL NDJSON to Loki streams (100 lines) | 170 us | 3118 | 70 KB |
| LogQL translation | ~5 us | ~20 | ~2 KB |

### Cache Story In One Table

These are the numbers that matter most when you want to judge the value of the cache stack rather than the implementation details:

| Path | Slow path | Fast path | What it means |
|---|---|---|---|
| `query_range` | `4.58 ms` cold miss with delayed backend | `0.64-0.67 us` warm cache hit | Repeated dashboards stop behaving like backend-bound requests |
| `detected_field_values` | `2.76 ms` without Tier0 | `0.71 us` with Tier0 | Drilldown metadata becomes effectively instant after warm-up |
| `L1` memory cache | full handler/backend path | `45 ns` hit | Local hot cache is essentially free |
| `L2` disk cache | backend refill | `0.45 us` uncompressed read, `3.9 us` compressed read | Persistent cache is still cheap enough for hot-path reuse |
| `L3` peer cache | backend or owner re-fetch | `52 ns` warm shadow-copy hit | A warm 3-node fleet can reuse results instead of refetching them |

Tier0 is most valuable on metadata-style and Drilldown-style endpoints where the proxy still has meaningful compatibility work to skip. On `query_range`, the deeper primary cache is already so effective that Tier0 mostly preserves that win rather than multiplying it.

### Throughput

| Scenario | Concurrency | Throughput | Avg Latency | Errors |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cache hit (labels) | 100 | 175,726 req/s | 6 us | 0 |
| No cache, 10 concurrent | 10 | 9,823 req/s | 102 us | 0 |
| No cache, 50 concurrent | 50 | 17,791 req/s | 56 us | 0 |
| No cache, 200 concurrent | 200 | 33,659 req/s | 30 us | 0 |
| Cache miss (1ms backend) | 50 | 12,976 req/s | 80 us | 0 |

### Resource Usage at Scale

| Load (req/s) | CPU (est.) | Memory | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | &lt;1% | ~10 MB | Idle, mostly cache hits |
| 1,000 | ~8% | ~20 MB | Mixed cache hit/miss |
| 10,000 | ~30% | ~50 MB | Backend-bound |
| 30,000+ | ~100% | ~100 MB | CPU-bound, scale horizontally |

### Memory Stability

Under sustained load (10K requests, no cache):
- Total allocation: ~70 KB/request (GC reclaims between requests)
- Live heap growth: **&lt;1 MB** (no leak)
- GC handles ~200 cycles per 10K requests

1000-line NDJSON body (700 bytes/line, 700 KB input): **1.2 MB allocated** total.

## Go Runtime Tuning

### GOMEMLIMIT

The Helm chart now injects `GOMEMLIMIT` at runtime. Resolution order:

1. `goMemLimit` when explicitly set
2. otherwise `goMemLimitPercent` of `resources.limits.memory`

In percentage mode, the chart computes bytes and exports that numeric value as `GOMEMLIMIT`.

```yaml
# Default: 85% of memory limit
goMemLimitPercent: 85   # 256Mi * 85% => GOMEMLIMIT=228589772 (bytes)

# Override with explicit value
goMemLimit: "500MiB"    # ignores goMemLimitPercent
```

Supported memory-limit units for percentage mode are integer quantities with `Ki|Mi|Gi|Ti|Pi|Ei|K|M|G|T|P|E`. If `resources.limits.memory` is missing or unsupported, the chart does not inject a computed `GOMEMLIMIT`.

### GOGC

`GOGC=200` is the proxy default (set via `-go-gc-percent=200`), halving GC frequency at the cost of higher peak RSS versus Go's default of 100. Set `-go-gc-percent=100` to restore Go's default, or lower it for tighter memory control.

### Go Runtime Metrics Exposed

The `/metrics` endpoint exposes Go runtime and GC statistics:

```
go_memstats_alloc_bytes      # current heap allocation
go_memstats_sys_bytes        # total OS memory
go_memstats_heap_inuse_bytes # heap in use
go_memstats_heap_idle_bytes  # heap idle
go_goroutines                # active goroutines
go_gc_cycles_total           # completed GC cycles
```

## CI Integration

The `bench` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` runs all benchmarks and load tests on every push. It:
1. Runs benchmarks 3x for stability
2. Runs load tests at all concurrency tiers
3. Fails the build if load tests produce errors (regression gate)
4. Uploads results as CI artifacts for historical tracking

The next CI step is to add compose-backed e2e cache/fleet smoke runs for pull requests and post-merge `main` builds, so Tier0 behavior and 3-node peer-cache gains are validated against the full Grafana + proxy + VictoriaLogs stack rather than only unit/load environments.

For `TestLoad_HighConcurrency_MemoryStability`, the throughput expectation is `>10k req/s` in local environments and `>5k req/s` on shared CI runners (`CI=true`) to reduce race-mode noise while still catching major regressions.
